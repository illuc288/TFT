\section{\textcolor{black}{Why should you care? An informal introduction}}
As the name suggests, this subject is two-sided: we have a physics part, namely Quantum Field Theory, and a mathematics part, more specifically topology and in particular (Co)Bordism. Let us explore the motivations and ideas behind these two subjects and how they come together. Do not worry if not everything is immediately clear, it will become so during the semester... hopefully.
\subsection{\textcolor{black}{QFT}}
\epigraph{Physics is very interesting:
There are many, many interesting theorems.
Unfortunately, there are no
definitions.}{David Kazhdan}
Start with a (smooth) manifold $M$ and, generally, some extra structure. For example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $M^4=\R^4$ with a metric with signature $(+, +, +, -)$, so that we can distinguish a strictly spatial part and a temporal part $(\R^4=\R^3_{space}\times\R^1_{time})$. This is called \textit{Minkowski Spacetime} and is particularly important in QFT being the geometric foundation of Special Relativity.
    \item $M^3=\R^3$ with the Euclidean metric.
    \item $M^2$ with a conformal structure.
    \item $M^{11}$ as an ``Elliptic Fibration'', something which \textit{locally} looks like $\left(S^1\times S^1\right)\times \ something$. These things are useful in areas with high-sounding names such as ``M-Theory'' or, more generically, ``String Theory''.
\end{itemize}
However, in general, these manifolds must be thought of with other structures, like connections, bundles...\\
Now we can ``define'' a Quantum Field Theory on $M$ via a list of ingredients:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{\textit{Fields}}. The \underbar{space} of fields $\mathcal{F}$, associated usually to a bundle $E\xrightarrow{p}M$, is defined as sections\footnote{A section of a bundle $E\xrightarrow{p}M$ is a map (in this context, smooth) $s:M\to E$ such that $p\circ s=id_M$.} of $E$ over $M$. In the case the bundle is trivial ($E\cong M\times X$), then $\mathcal{F}=\Gamma(M,E)=\text{Maps}(M\rightarrow X)$. But what is this thing? What do we mean by ``space'' here? Is it a set, a topological space, a category, a scheme, a stack...?\\
    \begin{figure}[!ht]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=8cm]{images/Lecture 1/penrose.png}
    \end{figure}
    %
    \item \textbf{\textit{Partition Function}}. We need a measure against which we can compute ``correlation functions'' of fields $\psi_1,\psi_2$ i.e. the ``likelihood of $\psi_1$ given $\psi_2$''. We thus define a Partition Function
    $$Z(M)=\int_{\psi\in\mathcal{F}}\ e^{iS(\psi)}\mathcal{D}\psi,$$
    with
    $$S(\psi)=\int_M \mathcal{L}(\psi),$$
    called the Action Functional. Generally $\mathcal{L}$ is a polynomial in the fields and it has derivatives. From the Partition Function one can obtain the correlation functions. Although physicists use this formula all the time, formally there is a problem: the measure $\mathcal{D}\psi$ is, in most cases, ill defined.
    \begin{figure}[!ht]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=9.2cm]{images/Lecture 1/feynman.png}
    \end{figure}
    %
    \item \textbf{\textit{Quantization}}. Often QFT arises from ``quantizing'' something classical. But what does this mean? And in what way does this thing behave when changing input?
\end{enumerate}
Physicists use all sorts of techniques (Feynman Diagrams, renormalization...) to make sense of undefined measures and divergences of all kinds emerging from calculations, dealing with things like $\infty-\infty$ or $\infty/\infty$ and obtaining finite and testable results.

This black box that physicists have (successfully) developed frustrates mathematicians because they do not understand why it works!

Therefore, axiomatizations have been developed exploiting new tools from geometry, algebra and topology to develop a formal and rigorous framework\footnote{More specifically to the path integral, see \cite[2.1]{Carqueville_2018} for an introduction on how topological field theories can be seen as a way to axiomatize some properties of the path integral as a tool to compute correlation functions.}.

\bigskip

The Partition Function $Z$ behaves well when ``smoothly'' changing the metric and is (in most cases) independent of most extra data of the manifold, so $Z(M)$ depends only on the smooth manifold and as such is purely topological!

If someone is into mathematics for the money or the prestige\footnote{If not already sufficiently clear, we explicitly state that this is a joke.}, the field of topological field theories is the one to specialize in: \begin{itemize}
    \item René Thom, the mathematician who laid the foundation of cobordism theory\footnote{Which is at the root of TFTs: TFTs can be seen as a refinement of his work.} in his PhD thesis, received the Fields Medal for this.
    \item Shiing-Shen Chern and Jim Simons discovered secondary characteristic classes of 3-dimensional manifolds called Chern-Simons forms, which underpinned the necessary tools to define the earliest example we have of a TFT: 3d Chern-Simons theory. Simons went on to found an incredibily successful hedge fund and became a billionaire. Chern continued to do groundbreaking work in differential geometry and topology; so much that some years ago the International Congress of Mathematicians named a prize after him: the \hyperlink{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chern_Medal}{Chern Medal}.
    \item Edward Witten received his Fields medal mainly because he found a link between 3d-TFTs, in particular Chern-Simons theory, and knot theory, in particular with the Jones polynomial. See \cite{Witten1989} for details.
\end{itemize} The Jones polynomial is a topological invariant of a knot, meaning that you can assign to each Knot a Jones Polynomial in such a way that if two Knots have different polynomials, then they must be different.
\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=5cm]{images/Lecture 1/Jones.jpg}
\end{figure}\\
What the heck do TFTs and Knots have in common?! There is actually a deep connection between the two.\\
When writing his paper, Witten drew several pictures like the following:
%The order of the images is compiled strangely
\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{images/Lecture 1/witten.png}
\end{figure}
\\
 Two mathematicians, Segal and Atiyah, recognized a hidden symmetric monoidal functor and pinned down  Witten's intuitions rigorously, thereby axiomatizing TQFTs (and CFTs).

\subsection{\textcolor{black}{Topology}}
\begin{flushleft}
\textit{Topology is the science of fundamental patterns\\
and structural relationships of event constellations.\\
-Fuller}
\end{flushleft}
The ideas behind cobordisms were developed already by Poincaré together with homology (and their group structure was discovered and investigated by Emmy Noether) but a proper definition was established by Pontryangin and Thom in the 20$^{\text{th}}$ century.\\
The strategy in general in (algebraic) topology is to probe a topological space by mapping into it, a way of viewing things very reminiscent of the Yoneda Lemma.\\
In the case of (singular) homology, we map simplices into the space of interest $S$. These maps are indexed by the dimension of the simplex as in the figure on the next page.
\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=6.5cm]{images/Lecture 1/simplex.png}
\end{figure}\\
We want to construct an algebraic structure around these maps $\sigma^{(n)}:\Delta^n\to S$ and so we  choose a set of coefficients, say $\R$, and construct the set of ``formal (finite) sums''  of $n$-simplices as
$$\sum a_i\sigma^{(n)}_i  ,$$
with $a_i\in\R$. Call this set $C_n(S)$. This is now an $\R$-Vector Space generated by the simplices. On the set of simplices we can introduce a map $\partial$, often called the differential or boundary, that takes each simplex to the alternating sum of the $n-1$ simplices that make up its boundary:
$$\partial\sigma^{(n)}:=\sum_{i=0}^{n}(-1)^i\sigma^{(n)}|_{\small{i^{\text{th}}-boundary}} \ ,$$
and then extend it linearly to $C_n(S)$. Calling $\partial_n:=\partial|_{C_n(S)}$, we have $\partial_n:C_n(S)\to C_{n-1}(S)$ and it can also be shown that $\partial_n \circ\partial_{n+1}=0\Leftrightarrow\partial^2=0$. This defines a chain complex structure.\\
Given the last identity, note that $\text{im}(\partial_{n+1})\subset \text{ker}(\partial_n)$ and therefore, we can define the $n^{\text{th}}$ homology of $S$ as
$$H_n(S)=\Big\{c^{(n)}: \ \ \partial_n c^{(n)}=0\Big\}\big{/}\Big\{f^{(n)}: \ \ f^{(n)}=\partial_{n+1} (f')^{(n+1)}\Big\}=\frac{\text{ker}(\partial_n)}{\text{im}(\partial_{n+1})},$$
and this is a vector space (by construction).
\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty, format = hang}
\begin{measuredfigure}
\includegraphics[width=10.40cm]{images/Lecture 1/homology.jpeg}
\caption{\small{Note that $x-x'=\partial\sigma$ so $x$ and $x'$ define the same element in $H_0$, similarly $\gamma-\gamma'=\partial\Sigma$ so that $\gamma$ and $\gamma'$ define the same element in $H_1$.}}
\end{measuredfigure}
\end{figure}

The elements of $H_1(S)$ and $H_2(S)$ can be characterized in different ways:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The elements of $H_1(S)$ can be represented by a collection of oriented loops mapped in $S$.
    $$\amalg \ S^1\longrightarrow S$$
    \item The elements of $H_2(S)$ can be represented by a collection of maps from closed oriented surfaces (e.g. genus $g-$surfaces) in $S$.
    $$\amalg \ \Sigma\longrightarrow S$$
    \item Let $c\in H_1(S)$ such that $c=\sum a_i\sigma_i$. Let $\partial c=0$, then by $1.$ this is some map $c: \amalg \ S^1\to S$, which is $0 \in H_1(S)$ if and only if it extends to a map $\tilde c$ of oriented surfaces in $S$, i.e. if there is the map on the bottom right such that the following diagram commutes.
    $$
    \begin{tikzcd}[row sep=tiny, column sep=small]
      \amalg \ S^1 \ar[drrr, "c"] \ar[dd, hook]\\
                  &&&S \\
      \amalg \ \Sigma \ar[urrr, dashrightarrow, "\tilde c"']
    \end{tikzcd}
    $$
    
    A drawing might be helpful:
    \begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=11cm]{images/Lecture 1/extension.png}
    \end{figure}
\end{enumerate}
But then can we construct something like homology but characterized more like this last property?\\
The idea is:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Let $M^n$ be a $n-$dimensional smooth compact manifold generally with boundary. Now, instead of maps from simplices we consider maps
    $$\large{M^n\xrightarrow{f} S}.$$
    \item Instead of the boundary map of simplices we consider something like:
    $$\partial\big(M^n\xrightarrow{f}S\big)=\big(\partial M^n\xrightarrow{f|_{\partial M^n}}S\big),$$
    where, if $\partial M^n=\emptyset$ then define the map to be $0$.
    \item Let $H^{\text{bord}}_n(S)$ denote this ``homology theory'' of degree $n$ on the space $S$. Let $M^n$ be closed, then $\large{M^n\xrightarrow{f} S}$ is zero in $H^{\text{bord}}_n(S)$ if and only if the map $f$ extends to a $(n+1)-$dimensional smooth compact manifold $W$ such that $\partial W= M$.
\end{enumerate}
Using these ideas one obtains something very similar to singular homology even though different, indeed this \textit{Bordism} constitutes a generalized homology theory\footnote{There exist a list of axioms called \textit{Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms} that is used to define what a homology theory is since it may come in different flavours. A generalized homology theory is a theory that has every property required but one, generally (as in the case of Bordism as seen below) that one is the \textit{dimension axiom}.}! %could later put a comparison TFTs/Eilenberg-Steenrod as in Ayala-Francis Cobordism Hypothesis

\medskip

Consider as a space, a point $S=\{*\}=pt$. What is $H^{\text{bord}}_n(pt)$?

Consider a suitable (closed) manifold $M^n\to pt$, since we are considering just a point we don't have to care about how the manifolds map into it, so this is $0$ if and only if $\exists W^{n+1}$ such that $\partial W^{n+1}=M^n$
    $$
    \begin{tikzcd}
M_1 \arrow[dd,  hook] \arrow[rd, dashed]                         \\
                                        & pt \\
M_2 \arrow[ru, dashed] 
\end{tikzcd}
    $$
But ``surely'' not all closed manifolds are a boundary of compact manifold! And so we can be sure that, in general, $H^{\text{bord}}_n(pt)\neq0$ for $n>0$.

\medskip

But when are two things the same in $H^{\text{bord}}_n$? If they are the boundary of the same manifold i.e. let $M_1\xrightarrow{f_1}S$ and $M_2\xrightarrow{f_2}S$ be closed manifolds, then they represent the same element in $H^{\text{bord}}_n$ if and only if $\exists W\xrightarrow{g}S$ compact manifold with boundary with the property that $\partial W= M_1 \amalg M_2$ and such that it makes the following diagram commute
    $$
    \begin{tikzcd}
M_1 \arrow[rd, hook] \arrow[rrd, bend left, "f_1"' description]         \\
                                        & W \arrow[r, "g"] & S \\
M_2 \arrow[ru, hook] \arrow[rru, bend right, "f_2" description]         
\end{tikzcd}
    $$
Pictorially
\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{images/Lecture 1/cobordism.png}
\end{figure}\\
We then say that $M_1$ and $M_2$ are \textit{cobordant} and $W$ is called a \textit{bordism} from $M_1$ to $M_2$. So we can define the \textit{Cobordism Group}
$$\Omega_n=
H^{\text{bord}}_n(pt)=
\bigg\{\text{Closed $n-$manifold}\bigg\}
\bigg{/}
\biggl\{(n+1)\text{ dimensional bordisms}
%\begin{array}{l}
%\text{Cobordant Compact}\\
%\text{$(n+1)-$manifolds}
%\end{array}
\biggl\}.$$\\
But are all these notions are actually useful? Well, classifying manifolds up to diffeomorphism is hard, dimension $0, 1$ and $2$ can be done without too much trouble but already in dimension $3$ things get complicated (think of the Poincaré Conjecture!)... so this classifications can be done (more easily) up to Bordism!

\section{Manifolds and bordisms}

Before venturing into a definition of cobordism, let us recall some useful definitions.

This section mainly relies on \cite{Lee2012} and \cite{Hirsch1976}.
\begin{defn}[\textit{Topological Manifold}]
	A topological manifold of dimension $n$ is a paracompact Hausdorff topological space $X$ such that every point $x \in X$ has an open neighborhood $U$ which is homeomorphic to an open set\footnote{Equivalently to $\R^n$.} in $\R^n$. The latter property means that for each $x\in X$\begin{itemize}
	    \item there exist an an open subset $U\subseteq X$ containing $x$, i.e. an open neighbourhood of $x$
     \item a corresponding open subset $\tilde{U}\in\R^n$
     \item a homeomorphism $\phi_{U} : U \to \tilde{U}=\phi(U) $ called coordinate chart, or just chart
	\end{itemize} 
 \end{defn}
 \begin{figure}

\begin{measuredfigure}
    \includegraphics[width=12cm]{images/Lecture 2/Coordinate Chart.png} \caption{\small{The visualization of a coordinate chart map from Lee's textbook on smooth manifolds \cite{Lee2012}}}
\end{measuredfigure}
\end{figure}
  If $(U, \phi)$, $(V, \psi)$ are two coordinate charts of a topological manifold $X$ and $U\cap V\neq\emptyset$, then $\psi \circ \phi^{-1} : \phi(U\cap V) \to \psi(U\cap V)$ is a transition function from $\phi$ to $\psi$.

\begin{defn}[Manifold with Boundary]
	A manifold with boundary of dimension $n$ is a paracompact Hausdorff topological space $X$ such that every point $p \in X$ has an open neighborhood $U_p$ which is homeomorphic to an open set $V$ in $\H^n = \{ (x_1, \dots, x_n) \in \R^n : x_1 \leq 0\}$, i.e. the closed\footnote{in topological sense and not in the manifold sense we later define.} half space, via the homeomorphism $\phi$ of the coordinate chart $(U_p,\phi)$.

\end{figure}

\begin{defn}[Boundary of a Manifold]
	If for $p \in X$ and some chart $\phi$ it is the case that $x_1(\phi (p) )= 0$ (meaning $\phi_p (x) \in \{(0,x_2, \dots, x_n)\}\subseteq \H^n$), then it does in every chart. We then say that $p$ is in the \textit{boundary} of $X$, 
	$$
		\de X := \{ p \in X : x_1(p) = 0\}
	$$
	otherwise, $p$ is in the \textit{interior} of $X$, which we denote with Int $X$. Equivalently, this means that $p$ has neighborhood $V$ that is the domain of a coordinate chart $\psi:V\to\H^n$ such that $\psi(V)\cap\de\H^n\neq\emptyset$ and sending $p$ to $\de \H^n$.

 Specularly, we could have defined the interior of $X$ to be the set of points $q\in X$ that have a neighourhood $U$ that is the domain of a chart $\psi:U\to\R^n$.
\end{defn}
\begin{lem}
    If $X$ is a $n$ dimensional manifold with boundary, then $\de X$ is a $n-1$ dimensional manifold.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
    Let $p\in\de X$ be an arbitrary point on the boundary of an $n$-manifold with boundary. Hence, there is an open neighbourhood $U_p$ of $p$ which is homeomorphic to an open set $V$ in $\mathbb{H}^n$, $ \phi(U_p)\cong V$. Since $p\in\de X$ we know that $x_1(\phi(p))=0$ and $\phi(p)\in V\cap\mathbb{H}^n$. $\phi:U_p\to V$ can be restricted to a homemorphism $\phi\mid_{\phi^{-1}(V\cap\mathbb{H}^n)}:\phi^{-1}(V\cap\mathbb{H}^n)\xrightarrow{\cong}V\cap\mathbb{H}^n$. Note that $\phi^{-1}(V\cap\mathbb{H}^n)=U_p\cap\de X$ because $p$ is sent to the boundary $\de\mathbb{H}^n$ for every chart. Note also that $\de\mathbb{H}^n=\{(0,x_2, \dots, x_n)\}$ and $\de\mathbb{H}^n\cong\R^{n-1}$. Since $V\cap\mathbb{H}^n\in\de\mathbb{H}^n$ and $V\cap\mathbb{H}^n\cong U_p\cap\de X$, $U_p\cap\de X$ is homeomorphic to an open set in $\R^{n-1}$.
\end{proof}
\begin{defn}[Closed Manifold]
    A manifold is \textit{closed} if it is compact and without boundary, i.e. $\de X = \emptyset$. Conversely, an \textit{open} manifold is also a manifold without boundary but with no closed components, i.e. it has only non-compact components. 
\end{defn}

In some contexts, it can be interesting to do calculus on a manifold. In order to make sense of this, one needs to add some extra structure to the topology of the manifold which enables investigating if a map between manifolds is smooth.
\begin{defn}[Smooth Function]
    Given $X\subseteq\R^n$ and $Y\subseteq\R^m$ a function $f:X\to Y$ is smooth\footnote{Also called infinitely differentiable or $C^\infty$.} if each of its component functions has continuous partial derivatives of all order.
\end{defn}
The right notion of isomorphism when talking about smooth functions is diffeomorphism:
\begin{defn}[Diffeomorphism]
    A smooth map $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is a diffeomorphism when it is bijective and has a smooth inverse map.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Smooth Manifold Without Boundary]
	A smooth manifold $X$ is a topological manifold, together with a collection of charts $\phi_i:U_i\to\R^n$, called smooth structure, $(U_i, \phi_i)$ such that:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $X = \bigcup_{i\in I} U_i$
		\item the pairwise transition functions are smooth in the usual sense of $\R^n$
  %what does 'pairwise' transition functions mean? Isn't 'transition functions and their inverses' clearer? /Andrea
		\item it is maximal with respect to 1. and 2.
	\end{enumerate}
 Some call a collection of charts $(U_i, \phi_i)$ such that $\{U_i\}_i\in I$ is a cover of the whole manifold $X$ an atlas. A smooth atlas is an atlas where the transition functions and their inverses are smooth. A smooth structure is thus a maximal smooth atlas. We call charts forming the smooth structure smooth charts.
\end{defn}

\begin{ex}
	A lot of the spaces we think of are smooth manifolds, such as:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item the circle, a dimension 1 manifold
		\item a genus $g$ surface, a dimension 2 manifold
		\item $\emptyset$, a smooth manifold of any dimension
	\end{enumerate}
\end{ex}
\begin{notat}
    In these lecture notes, manifolds are \textit{always} smooth, unless explicitly specified.
\end{notat}
\begin{rem}
    The definition of smoothness does we just provided does not work for manifolds with boundary since to say that the transition functions are smooth we used the notion of smoothness of $\R^n$ and not of $\H^n$, the actual codomain of manifolds \emph{with} boundary. Hence, we characterize now smoothness for $\H^n$
\end{rem}

Recall that a map $f:M\to\R^m$ where $M\subseteq \R^n$ is not necessarily open is smooth if in a neighbourhood of each $x\in M$ it can be extended to a smooth function defined on an open subset in $\R^n$. 

\begin{defn}[Smoothness in the Half Space]\label{SmoothHalf}
    If $X$ is an open subset of $\H^n$, we define $f:X\to\R^m$ to be smooth for each $x\in X$ if $X$ can be extended to an open subset $\tilde{X}\in\R^n$, and $f$ to a smooth map $\tilde{f}:\tilde{X}\to\R^m$ such that $\tilde{f}|_{\tilde{X}\cap\H^n}=f$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Smooth Manifold with Boundary]
    A topological manifold with boundary is smooth if it has a maximal smooth atlas where the transition functions and their inverses are smooth according to \ref{SmoothHalf}.
\end{defn}

\begin{cor}
    If $X$ is a smooth $n$ dimensional manifold with boundary, then $\de X$ is a smooth $n-1$ dimensional manifold. It follows from the proof for topological manifolds.
\end{cor}

    Let $X$ be a smooth manifold. $f:X\to\R^n$ is smooth if for each $x\in X$ there is a smooth chart $(U,\phi)$ such that $f=f\circ\phi^-1$
\end{defn}
This definition can be generalized to maps to arbitrary smooth manifolds.
\begin{defn}[Smooth Map between Manifolds]
    Let $X$ and $Y$ be smooth manifolds and $f:X\to Y$ a function between them. $f$ is smooth if for every $x\in X$ there is a smooth chart $(U,\phi)$ of $X$ where $x\in U$ and a smooth chart $(V,\psi)$ of $Y$ where $f(x)\in V$ and $f(U)\subseteq V$ such that $\psi \circ f\phi^-1$ is smooth.

\subsection{What is a Bordism?}

\begin{defn}[$1^{st}$ variant of the definition of bordism: via \emph{strict equalities}]
\label{Define Bordism}
	Let $Y_0, Y_1$ be closed $n$-manifolds. A bordism $(X,p)$ from $Y_0$ to $Y_1$ consists of a compact $n+1$ manifold with boundary together with a map $p: \de X \to \{0,1\}$ such that $Y_0 = p^{-1}(0)$ and $Y_1 = p^{-1}(1)$. Thus, $\de X = Y_0 \amalg Y_1$.

	We say that $Y_0$ and $Y_1$ are \textit{Cobordant}.
\end{defn}
We call $Y_0$ the \textit{incoming} boundary and $Y_1$ the \textit{outgoing} boundary. We sometimes write $\de_{in} X = Y_0$ and $\de_{out} X = Y_1$

    A bordism between $M_1\sqcup M_2$ and $M_1\#M_2$ may be constructed in the following manner (proof stolen from the \href{http://www.map.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/Bordism#Connected_sum_and_bordism}{Manifold Atlas Project}). Consider a cylinder $M_1\times I$, from which we remove an $\epsilon$-neighbourhood $U_{\epsilon}(v_{1}\times 1)$ of the point $v_{1}\times 1$. Similarly, remove the neighbourhood $U_{\epsilon}(v_{2}\times 1)$ from $M_{2}\times I$ (each of these two neighbourhoods can be identified with the half of a standard open $(n+1)$-ball). Now connect the two remainders of cylinders by a "half pipe" $\left(S_{n}\leq 0 \right)\times I$ in such a way that the half-sphere $S_{n}\leq 0$ is identified with the half-sphere on the boundary of $U_{\epsilon}(v_{1}\times 1)$, and $\left(S_{n}\leq 0 \right)\times I$ is identified with the half-sphere on the boundary of $U_{\epsilon}(v_{2}\times 1)$. Smoothening the angles we obtain a manifold with boundary $(M_1\sqcup M_2)\sqcup(M_1\#M_2)$.

\begin{thm}
\label{Cobordant Equiv}
Being cobordant is an equivalence relation on closed $n-$manifolds. 
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
We need to show that the relation satisfies the properties of reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reflexive: $Y_0 \sim Y_0$ since we can take $X = Y_0 \times [0,1]$ as 1. in the previous example. We then have $\de X = Y_0 \times \{0,1\} \xrightarrow{p} \{0,1\}$. 
    %
    \item Symmetric: assume $Y_0 \sim Y_1$. Thus, we have $(X,p)$ from $Y_0$ to $Y_1$. We can use the same manifold and compose $p$ with the $swap$ of 0 and 1 in order to get 
    $$\tilde{p}=swap \circ p:\de X\xrightarrow{p}\{0,1\}\xrightarrow{swap}\{1,0\}$$ Consequently, $(X, swap \circ p)$ is a bordism from $Y_1$ to $Y_0$.
    %
    \item Transitive: we have $Y_0 \sim Y_1$ via $(X_1, p_1)$ and $Y_1 \sim Y_2$ via $(X_2, p_2)$. Then we can use as a manifold $X = X_1 \cup_{Y_1} X_2$ where $\cup_{Y_1}$ indicates the gluing along $Y_1$. This is a manifold but there's some work involved in showing it's a \textit{smooth} manifold and it will be done later on (\ref{BordantTransitive}), via an equivalent definition of bordism. We then think of the boundary in the following way $\de X = \de_{in} X_1 \amalg \de_{out} X_2$.
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\subsection{Cobordism groups}\label{Cob Groups}
\begin{defn}
\label{Defn n-th cob group}
The $n$-th cobordism group is
$$\Omega_n = \frac{\{\text{closed $n$ manifolds}\}}{\{\text{$n+1-$cobordisms}\}}$$
\end{defn}
\begin{rem}
There is an insidious set-theoretic issue when we define the $n$-th cobordism group $\Omega_n$ (\ref{Defn n-th cob group}): is the collection of all closed $n-$manifolds a set? And what about the collection of all $n+1-$bordisms? It could be the case that it is something bigger than a usual set, thus not a set and problematic since we would not know how to treat them\footnote{We are assuming to be working in ZFC. There are other set theories in which one can define collections greater than sets, e.g. Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory.}. For example, we know that the collection of all sets is strictly greater than any set\footnote{Because of famous set-theoretic paradoxes like Cantor's paradox.} and thus not a set. Similarly, also the collection of topological spaces is not a set because we can regard any set as a topological space via the discrete topology\footnote{The topology where the set of open sets is the powerset of the set in question, or in other words where any subset is open.}. One could wonder if the collection of all manifolds of a certain dimension $n$ is likewise not a set. This is fortunately for us not the case. We can prove it via the following theorem\footnote{This result is not important only in this case, but notably for the interest of this class it was used to construct an apt category of bordisms \ref{CobCat} in order to sketch a partial proof of the most important conjecture in the field of TFTs: the cobordism hypothesis; see for details on this \cite{lurie2009classification} and \cite{Calaque_2019}.} 
\begin{thm}[Whitney Embedding theorem]
    Any $n-$manifold can be embedded in $\R^{\infty}(=\cup_{n\in\N}\R^n)$. The space of such embeddings is contractible.\footnote{Note that there are refinements of the latter result.}
    %It would be better to have \bigcup instead of \cup in \R^{\infty}(=\cup_{n\in\N}\R^n$) but \bigcup does not compile
\end{thm}
 We can thus happily treat \{\text{closed $n$ manifolds}\} and \{\text{$n+1-$cobordisms}\} as sets by replacing abstract manifolds and cobordism by manifolds and cobordisms embedded in $\R^{\infty}$.

To compute this, consider the following classification of $1$-manifolds:

\begin{prop}
Any $1$ dimensional compact manifold with boundary is diffeomorphic to a finite disjoint union of closed intervals $[0,1]$ and circles $S^1$.
\end{prop}

\begin{ex}
An example of a $1$-dimensional cobordism is $W=[0,1]$. Here is the 3 different way of seeing it as a bordism: from $Y_0 = \{0,1\}$ to $Y_1 = \emptyset$, from $Y_0 = \{0\}$ to $Y_1 = \{1\}$ and from $Y_0 = \emptyset$ to $Y_1 = \{0,1\}$.

\noindent Keeping this pattern in mind, consider a disjoint union of a finite collection of points (i.e. the only closed $1$-manifolds)

\begin{itemize}
	\item If $k$ is even, we can find a bordism to $\emptyset$
	\item If $k$ is odd, we can find a bordism to $\{*\}$
\end{itemize}

We then have $2k$ points $\sim \emptyset$, while $2k+1$ points $\sim 1$ point. Therefore, the 0-th cobordism group is given by
\begin{equation}
    \Omega_0 = \{ \emptyset, \{*\}\} \cong \Z_2.
\end{equation}
A possible variation is: add a ``decoration'', called \textit{orientation} (will be made more precise later), so we now have:
$$\Omega_0^{\textit{or}} = \big\{\text{finite sets of points $S$ with a map } S \to \{+,-\}\big\} /\{\text{oriented cobordism}\}$$
An oriented cobordism in $1$ dimension is given by $[0,1]$ or $S^1$ which comes with an orientation. %DRAWING

\subsubsection{The 1st cobordism group, \texorpdfstring{$\Omega_{1}$}{Omega 1}}
Now we have
$$\Omega_1= \{\text{closed $1$-dimensional manifolds}\} / \{\text{$2$-dimensional cobordisms}\}.$$
\begin{thm}
    Any closed $1$-dimensional manifold is a finite disjoint union of circles
\end{thm}
A circle is the boundary of a 2-disk, so $S^1 \sim \emptyset$. Hence, also finite disjoint unions of $S^1$ are cobordant to the empty set. Therefore, the trivial group is the $1$st cobordism group
\begin{equation}
    \Omega_1 = 0
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{The 2nd cobordism group, \texorpdfstring{$\Omega_{2}$}{Omega 2}}
In order to find the $2$nd cobordism group, we first need a classification of $2$-manifolds. %(Introduced before) In order to state the result we need to introduce the concept of \textit{connected sum}
%\begin{defn}[Connected Sum]
	%Given $n$ manifolds $M,N$, their connected sum $M\# N$ is given by
	%%M\# N = M \setminus (D^n)^\circ \cup_{\de D^n \times [0,1]} N \setminus (D^n)^\circ

\end{prop}

We can now use this knowledge to compute
$$
	\Omega_2^{\text{or}} = \{\text{closed oriented $2$-manifolds} \} /\{\text{$3$-dimensional oriented cobordisms}\}
$$
by observing that $S^2$ and $\Sigma_g$ are both cobordant to $\emptyset$ since they can simply be ``filled'' to a $3$ dimensional manifold with boundary, we get
\begin{equation}
    \Omega_2^{or} = 0.

\begin{rmnd}[Definition \ref{Define Bordism} of Bordism]
Let $Y_0, Y_1$ be closed $n$-manifolds. A bordism $(X,p)$ from $Y_0$ to $Y_1$ consists of a compact $n+1$ manifold with boundary together with a map $p: \de X \to \{0,1\}$ such that $Y_0 \text{\colorbox{yellow}{=}} p^{-1}(0)$ and $Y_1 \text{\colorbox{yellow}{=}} p^{-1}(1)$ (hence $\de X \text{\colorbox{yellow}{=}}  Y_0 \amalg Y_1$). We say that $Y_0$ and $Y_1$ are \textit{Cobordant}.
\end{rmnd}

\noindent There was a complaint: why don't we use diffeomorphisms instead of the highlighted equalities? This question arises because even with simple examples the equality seems too strict:

\begin{rmnd}[from \ref{Cobordant Equiv}]
Being cobordant is an equivalence relation.
\end{rmnd} 

\noindent In particular, for any closed $n-$manifold $Y$ we have $Y\sim Y$. The bordism is given by the cylinder $Y\times [0,1]$, where $p:Y\times\{0,1\}\to \{0,1\}$. Then $Y\times\{0\}=p^{-1}(0)$, but $Y\neq Y\times\{0\}$! 
It seems like our previous definition does not actually give rise to an equivalence relation. Instead, if we substitute the strict equalities with diffeomorphisms (isomorphisms in the category of smooth manifolds) things seem to work out flawlessly:

\begin{defn}[$2^{nd}$ variant of the definition of Bordism: via diffeomorphisms]
\label{NewDefBord}
    Let $Y_0, Y_1$ be closed $n$-manifolds. A bordism from $Y_0$ to $Y_1$ is a quadruple $(X,p,\phi_{0},\phi_{1})$ consisting of a compact $n+1-$manifold with boundary $\de X$ together with maps $p: \de X \to \{0,1\}$, $\phi_{0}:Y_{0}\to p^{-1}(0)$, $\phi_{1}:Y_{1}\to p^{-1}(1)$ such that $\phi_{0}:Y_{0}\xrightarrow{\cong}p^{-1}(0)$, $\phi_{1}:Y_{1}\xrightarrow{\cong}p^{-1}(1)$ and $\de X\xrightarrow{\cong} Y_0 \amalg Y_1$.
    %TODO also here we can write "and hence X = Y_0 U Y_1", right?
\end{defn}

\begin{ex}
    Let $\psi:M\xrightarrow{\cong} N$ be a diffeomorphism.
    Then $(M\times [0,1], M\times\{0,1\}\xrightarrow{p}\{0,1\}, \phi_0, \phi_1)$, with maps
    $$\phi_0:M\xrightarrow{id\times\{0\}}p^{-1}(0)=M\times \{0\}$$
    $$\phi_1:N\xrightarrow{\psi^{-1}\times\{1\}}p^{-1}(1)=M\times\{1\}$$
    gives a bordism from $M$ to $N$.
    This is called the mapping cylinder of $\psi$. 
    
    \noindent$\Rightarrow$ under the new definition, \underbar{any} two diffeomorphic manifolds are also cobordant.
\end{ex}
%TODO fix example: is it okay now? Didn't change much, that's why I ask
% it's not really clear what the mapping cylinder is

Why does this not change the definition of bordism?
Because any diffeomorphism also gives a bordism in the old sense:
Given $M\xrightarrow{\cong}N$, take the gluing $(M\times I)\underset{M\times\{1\}}{\cup_{\psi}}N$ so that $Y_1=N$ and $Y_0=M\times \{0\}"="M$ (abusing notation).
%is there a difference between this and the example above?

%TODO put this earlier or delete it
\begin{defn}
    Let $M^m$ and $N^n$  be smooth manifolds with boundary\footnote{The indices denote the dimensions of the manifolds.}.
A smooth map is a continuous map $f:M\to N$ such that $\forall x\in M$ and all charts $(U_x,\phi_x)$ and $(V_{f(x)}, \psi_{f(x)})$ the map $\tilde f=\psi_{f(x)}\circ f|_{U_x}\circ \phi_x^{-1}$ is a smooth map in the usual $\R$ sense.

\end{tikzcd}\]
\end{defn}
\begin{notat}[Half-space]
    By $\mathbb{H}^n$ we denote the $n$-dimensional upper (closed) half-space,
    $$\mathbb{H}^n=\{(x_1,...,x_n)\in\mathbb{R}^n|x_n\geq 0\}$$ 
\end{notat}
\begin{defn}
    A diffeomorphism is a smooth map with a smooth inverse, i.e. an isomorphism in the category of smooth manifolds.
\end{defn}

\noindent Now we prove the transitivity of the relation 'being cobordant'. We do that by showing that given $X$ from $Y_0$ to $Y_1$ and $X'$ from $Y_1$ to $Y_2$, we can glue them along the boundary in common, $Y_1$, to obtain a bordism from $Y_0$ to $Y_2$. %add diagram here (?) later works as well
In order to achieve this, we need to introduce the following notion:
\begin{defn}
    Let $X$ be a manifold with boundary. A collar of the boundary is an open set  $U\subseteq X$ containing $\de X$ together with a diffeomorphism  $(-\epsilon,0]\times\partial M \to U$ for some $\epsilon>0$.
\end{defn}
\begin{thm}
	The boundary of a manifold with boundary always has a collar.
\end{thm}
Idea of the proof: I have a manifold with boundary, locally at $x\in\de X$ we have 
$$(-\epsilon_x, 0]\times V_x\xrightarrow{\cong} U_x\subseteq\mathbb{H}^n$$
where $V_x$ is an open neighbourhood of $x$ in $\de X$.

\noindent Now we use a standard trick in differential geometry/topology (see \cite{Hirsch1976}): globally patch these diffemorphisms using a partition of unity. It works if $X$ is compact.

\begin{defn}[$3^{rd}$ variant of the definition of bordism: via collars]
    Let $Y_0$ and $Y_1$ be closed n-manifolds. A bordism from $Y_0$ to $Y_1$ is a quadruple $(M, p, \phi_0, \phi_1)$ with $M$ and $p$ as before. $\phi_0, \phi_1$ are given by
    $$\phi_0:[0, \epsilon)\times Y_0\to U \supseteq p^{-1}(0)$$
    $$\phi_1:(-\epsilon, 0]\times Y_1\to V \supseteq p^{-1}(1)$$
    where $U$ and $V$ together form a collar of the boundary of $M$.
\end{defn}

\noindent Moreover, 
$$([0, \epsilon)\times Y_0\big)\cup((-\epsilon, 0]\times Y_1)\xrightarrow{\phi_0\sqcup\phi_1}U\sqcup V\supseteq p^{-1}(0)\sqcup p^{-1}(1)=\de M$$

This variant of the definition is equivalent to the other two but we would unfortunately need a lot of differential topology in order to prove this.

\begin{proof}[Transitivity of Cobordant]\label{BordantTransitive}
    We need a maximal atlas with smooth transition functions. Clearly, in the interior points of $X$ and $X'$ this exists since we can use directly the charts of $X$ and $X'$. The problem is the double collar around $Y_1$. So we need to construct charts around points on $Y_1$. Take $U_1^{-}\underset{Y_1}{\cup}U_1^{+}$ in an open neigbourhood. Then via $U_1^{-}\underset{Y_1}{\cup}U_1^{+}\xrightarrow{\phi_1\cup\phi'_0}(-\epsilon,\epsilon)\times Y_0=(-\epsilon,0]\cup[0,\epsilon)\times Y_0$ which contains $(-\epsilon,\epsilon)\times V_x$ which maps to $\R^n$ via $\psi_x$ and thereby generating a maximal atlas.
\end{proof}
%I am confused by the directions of /phi_1,0 etc... 
let $X$ be a bordism between $Y_0$ to $Y_1$ and $X'$ between $Y_1$ and $Y_0$.

\subsection{Tangential Structures}
\subsubsection{Orientations and the tangent bundle}
\begin{defn}[Tangent bundle]
    $TM$ is the vector bundle over $M$ of rank $n$ is constructed as
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Fibers are the tangent spaces $T_p M$ at each point $p \in M$: $$(TM)_p=T_pM$$
        \item (as a set) $TM=\bigcup_{p\in M} T_p M$ with natural projection: $$TM=\bigcup_{p\in M} T_p M\xrightarrow{p}M$$ $$(p,v)\mapsto p$$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{defn}
%why does \bigcup not compile?
It is possible to define a topology on $TM$ such that it is a smooth $2n$-manifold: $(U,\phi)$ chart of $M$, we have a chart of $TM$, $(p^{-1}(U),\tilde\phi$ by looking at preimages of $U$ under the projection map and we construct the local trivialization with the usual construction. This is summarized by the fact that the following diagram commutes:
\[\begin{tikzcd}
	{p^{-1}(U)=TU=\bigcup_{p\in U}T_pM} && {T\tilde U=\tilde U\times\R^n} \\
	\\
	U && {\tilde U\subseteq\R^n}
	\arrow["p", from=1-1, to=3-1]
	\arrow["{\tilde\phi=(\phi,\partial\phi)}"', from=1-1, to=1-3]
	\arrow["pr", from=1-3, to=3-3]
	\arrow["\phi"', from=3-1, to=3-3]
	\arrow["\cong", from=3-1, to=3-3]
\end{tikzcd}\]
This is actually an atlas with smooth structure. Transition functions are actually the jacobian (which are in $GL_n(\R)$).

\begin{defn}
    If $TM$ has local trivializations, i.e. an open cover $(U_i)_{i\in I}$ and transition functions $\phi_{i,j}(\in GL_n(\R))$ such that the transition functions between overlapping trivializations are $\phi_{i,j}\in GL_n^+(\R)\subseteq GL_n(\R)$ then we say that $M$ is orientable.

    In other words "The structure group of $TM$ can be reduced to $GL_n^+ (\R) \subset GL_n(\R)$".
    
    Analogously, given some $G \subset GL_n(\R)$, we can say $M$ admits a $G$ structure if the local trivialisations are such that $\phi_{i,j} \in G$, i.e. "the structure group can be reduced to $G$". In this sense, being orientable is the same as admitting a $GL_n^+ (\R)$ structure.

	All these are orientable. Instead examples of non orientable manifolds are the Klein bottle, the Möbius strip and $\R\P^2$.

    An orientation (equivalently, a $GL^+_n(\R)$ structure) of $M$ is an equivalence class of trivialisations $\{(\tilde U, \tilde \phi)\}$ such that $\det g_{ij} > 0$ (i.e. $g_{ij} \in GL^+(n,\R)$), where $g_{ij} = \phi_j \circ \phi_i^{-1}|_{\dots}$.

    Analogously, given some $G \subset GL_n(\R)$, a $G$ structure is an equivalence class of trivialisations $\{(\tilde U, \tilde \phi)\}$ such that $g_{ij} \in G$.
\end{defn}

\noindent We can now note the following lemma which we won't prove.
\begin{lem}
	A $GL_n^+ (\R)$ structure is the same as an $SO(n)$ structure.
\end{lem}

How many orientations can $M$ have? 0 if it's not orientable, 2 if it's connected and orientable, in general $2^{\# \text{ connected components}}$ if it's orientable.

\begin{defn}
	$M$ oriented with charts $\{(U_i, \phi_i)\}$. The opposite orientation on $M$ is given by: $\{(U_i, \bar \phi_i)\}$ in which $\bar \phi_i$ is given by the following composition
	\begin{equation}
		U_i \xrightarrow{\phi_i} \R^n \to \R^n %TODO write better
	\end{equation}
	We will indicate $M$ with opposite orientation by $\bbar M$.
\end{defn}

\begin{ex}
	$S^1$ %DRAWING
\end{ex}

\begin{defn}
	A diffeomorphism $\psi: M \to N$ between oriented manifolds is orientation preserving (reversing) if the orientation on $N$ induced by the one on $M$ is the (opposite) orientation on $N$.
\end{defn}
\begin{ex}
	Consider maps $S^1 \to S^1$ (implicitly using the same orientation on each $S^1$). The identity is an orientation preserving map, while the map $x \mapsto \bar x$ is orientation reversing (considering $S^1 \subset \C$).

	We could instead consider maps $S^1 \to \bar{S^1}$. In this case the identity is orientation reversing.

\end{ex}

Given a manifold $M$ with boundary, its tangent bundle (how is it defined?) contains a copy of $T(\de M)$.
%DRAWING
This is because we can "glue another collar" $[0,\epsilon]$ onto the boundary so that the points that were on the boundary are now interior points. This allows us to define $T_x M$, the tangent bundle at the boundary. Instead, considering $\de M$ as its own manifold we have $T_x \de M$ and we have that $T_x \de M \subset T_x M$ and it has codimension 1. We can then define the quotient
$$
	\nu_x = T_x M /T_x \de M
$$
and we can write the following short exact sequence of bundles on $\de M$.
\begin{equation}
	0 \to T(\de M) \to i^* TM \to \nu \to 0
\end{equation}
in which $i: \de M \to M$ is the inclusion and $i^*: TM$ (bundle over $M$) $\to TM$ (bundle over $\de M$) is its pullback. 
%TODO did I understand this correctly?
If we fix a local chart with coordinates $x_1, \dots, x_n$ we have a basis $\frac{\de}{\de x_1}$ for $\nu$.

This has the following consequences:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item an orientation on $M$ induces one on $\de M$
	\item $\nu$ has two "orientations" ($\cong$ normal directions)
	\item an orientation on $\de M$ induces one on $\de M \times (0,1)$ (if I choose an orientation on $(0,1)$) but in general we can extend this construction to all of $M$.
\end{enumerate}

More generally, note that if $M$ and $N$ are oriented, then $M\times N$ is oriented. \cite{FreedBordism}


\begin{ex}
	Special case: 0 dimensional manifold. $M = \{x_1, \dots, x_k\}$, but $T_x M = 0$ so our definition fails! So in this case the definition does not capture what we would like, in particular the consequences we found before are 1. tautological, 3. boring. We can use 3. to construct a new definition.
\end{ex}
\begin{defn}
	An orientation on a 0 dimensional manifold is a map $M \to \{\pm 1\}$ ($\iff$ orientation of $M \times (0,1)$ if I fixed a chosen orientation of (0,1)).
	%DRAWING
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	Let  $Y_0$ and $Y_1$ be oriented closed $n$ manifolds.
	An oriented bordism from $Y_0$ to $Y_1$ is an oriented $n+1$ manifold $X$ together with $p: \de X \to \{0,1\}$ and $\psi: \de X \to \bbar Y_0 \amalg Y_1$ an orientation preserving diffeomorphism.
	(Note: now $p$ is actually too much data $\dots$, since it basically tells us which of the $Y_i$ we're reversing, so we can get rid of it)
\end{defn}
Again this is an equivalence relation which we call "being oriented cobordant", which allows us to give the following definition.
\begin{defn}
	The oriented bordism group is:
	\begin{equation}
		\Omega_n^{or} = \{\text{closed oriented $n$ manifolds}\}/\{\text{oriented $n+1$ cobordisms}\}
	\end{equation}
\end{defn}
Note that $\emptyset$ is an oriented $n$ manifold with a unique orientation.

\subsubsection{Framings} % (fold) 
\label{sub:framings}

% I added this to the previous definitions
% \begin{defn}
%     If $TM$ has local trivialisations $\dots$ $g_{ij} \in G \subseteq GL_n(\R)$, $M$ has a $G$ structure. A choice of $G$ structure is an equivalence class of such trivialisations.
% \end{defn}

Recall the definition of a $G$ structure given above. As stated previously, if $G = GL_n^+(\R)$ a $G$ structure is an orientation. Another choice is simply to take $G = \{e\}$, this gives a \textit{framing}. We can talk about \textit{frameable} or \textit{parallelizable} manifolds, meaning they admit a framing. As a consequence, for a manifold with trivial tangent bundle we have $TM \cong M \times \R^n$ and a choice of framing corresponds to a choice of isomorphism.

\begin{ex}
Some examples of frameable manifolds are the following:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For $\R^n$, we have $T\R^n \cong \R^n \times \R^n$
        \item $S^1$
        \item $S^1 \times S^1$
        %choose how many times I rotate when following the circles --> framing
        \item Any Lie group $H$ has $TH \cong H \times \R^{\dim}$
    \end{itemize}
    What about $S^2$? Not frameable because of the hairy ball theorem (we would need two vector fields that are a basis at each point of $S^2$ but because of the theorem we don't even have one).
        %Well for any point $p \in S^1$ we have $T_p S^1 \cong \R$ and the isomorphism is given by a choice of vector. 
\end{ex}

\begin{fct}
	The only closed connected 2 manifolds with framing is the torus.
\end{fct}

\begin{lem}
	Any framing on an $n$ manifold $M$ induces an orientation on $M$.
\end{lem}
\noindent From our definition it's immediate because $\{e\} \subseteq GL_n^+$ (however there are other definitions of orientation for which it's not immediate).

\subsection{Classification of 2 manifolds with boundary} % (fold) // what do you mean by '(fold)'? /andrea
\label{sub:classification_of_2_manifolds_with_boundary}

The aim of this chapter is to prove the aforementioned classification of compact 2-dimensional manifolds with the use of Morse Theory (see \ref{Classification of 2-manifolds}). We remind the reader: let $M$ be a 2-manifold with genus $g$, then \begin{itemize}
    \item $M$ is classified by its genus $g$, if $M$ is oriented. This means that $M$ it is diffeomorphic to $\Sigma_g:=T\#...\#T$, the connected sum of $g$-tori, where in particular $\Sigma_0=S^2$
    \item whereas if $M$ is unorientable, $M$ is diffeomorphic to $g$ copies of the real projective plane, i.e.  $\R P^2\#...\#\R P^2$
\end{itemize} every 2-dimensional manifold is  One can find a thorough covering of this result in \cite{Hirsch1976}

We now want to find a classification of compact 2 manifolds with boundary (which we will simply call \textit{surface}). To do it we will need Morse theory. What is the idea? Given a surface $M$ (it works in greater generality but now we're only interested in surfaces), find a map $f: M \to \R$ which is "nice" is a way we'll specify later on.
Then by analizing properties of $f$ we can recover the topology of the surface (i.e. the surface up to diffeomorphism). 
\subsubsection{Introduction to Morse Theory}
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=9.3cm]{images/Lecture on Morse Theory/TORUS MORSE THEORY.png}
    \caption{Image of the Morse function of a torus from \cite{HiroLee2022}}
    \label{TORUS MORSE}
\end{figure}
With the projection map from the torus, see \ref{TORUS MORSE}, we have 4 special points: the top and bottom, and then the two points in the middle. What happens in these points is that the shape of the preimage changes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the preimage of the top (and bottom) is a point
	\item the preimage of points between the top and middle point is a circle
	\item the preimage of the middle points is a wedge of circles
	\item the preimage of points between the middle points is a disjoint union of circles.
\end{itemize}
Note that at the special points the preimage is generally not a smooth manifold. The \textit{special} points are called critical values of $f$, while the other points are regular values.
%TODO add what the strategy is

\begin{defn}
	Let $M$ be a closed $n$ manifold. A critical point of $f: M \to \R$ is a point $p \in M$ such that $(df)_p: T_p M \to T_{f(p)} \R \cong \R$ is \textit{not} surjective. 
	A critical value is the image of a critical point.
\end{defn}

The main goal then is to recover (up to diffeomorphism) $M$ from knowing the critical points and the behaviour in a neighborhood thereof. 


Firstly we can define what a "nice" function is:
\begin{defn}
	A Morse function is a smooth map $f: M \to \R$ such that all critical points are nondegenerate, that is 
	$\Hess(f)_p := \left( \frac{\de^2 f}{\de x_i \de x_j}(p)\right)_{i,j}$
	is non-singular.
\end{defn}
\begin{rem}
	This is independent of the choice of chart. 
\end{rem}

\begin{ex}
	Let's start with a nonexample: %DRAWING

	At every critical point the second derivative is 0:
	\begin{equation}
		\Hess(f)_p = \begin{pmatrix}
			-2 & 0 \\
			0 & 0 
		\end{pmatrix}	
	\end{equation}
	Since the function is given by $f(x_1, x_2) = -x_1^2$.

	Anothe nonexample is given by the function $f(x) = x^3$. Consider the map that goes from the graph of $f$ to its $y$ coordinate. Again the Hessian is 0.
\end{ex}

%other example $f(x_1, x_2) = -x_1^2 -x_2^2$
% hessian is -2 0, 0 -2, two negative eigenvalues -> index -2

We're then interested in the local picture at a critical point.

\begin{defn}
	If $p \in M$ is a nondegenerate critical point of $f : M \to \R$, the index of $f$ at $p$ is 
	\begin{equation}
		\ind_f (p) = \text{index of }\Hess(f)_p = \# \text{ negative eigenvalues of} \Hess(f)_p
	\end{equation}
\end{defn}

\begin{ex}
	Basic examples: %DRAWINGS
	%functions -x_1^2-x_2^2, -x_1^2+x_2^2, x_1^2-x_2^2, x_1^2+x_2^2
	% hessians and indices ...
\end{ex}

\begin{lem}[Morse Lemma]
	Let $p \in M^n$ be a nondegenerate critical point of $f: M \to \R$ of index $k$. Then there is a chart $(U, \phi)$ around $p$ such that
	\begin{equation}
		M \supset U \to \dots %TODO diagram
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
		\tilde f (x_1, \dots, x_n) = f(p) - \sum_{i=1}^k x_i^2 + \sum_{j=k+1}^n x_j^2
	\end{equation}
\end{lem}
%TODO sum symbol not appearing, I think again because of font
\noindent Idea of proof: given a nondenerate critical point of index $k$ we only know that $\Hess(f)_p$ has $k$ negative eigenvalues, is nonsingular and is diagonalizable. That allows me to change the basis so that the function takes that form, essentially doing a Taylor expansion. In particular then the chart can be chosen such that the function is \textit{exactly} that expression.


% -------------------------------------------------------------
% --------------------- LECTURE 6 13/11 -----------------------
% -------------------------------------------------------------

Immediate consequences of the lemma:
Given a Morse function $f: M \to \R$, $p \in M$, then
\begin{itemize}
    \item if $p$ is critical (non degenerate because of the \textit{Morse} function), because of the lemma we have a chart as above. Then the level sets $f^{-1} (f(p))$ look like a neighborhood of 0 in a quadric (locally).
    \item if $p$ is not critical (it's regular), by the implicit function theorem there are coordinates such that $f(x_1, \dots, x_n) = x_1$. So the level sets $f^{-1} c$ look like hyperplanes in $\R^n$ (locally).
\end{itemize}

\begin{thm}
    For any manifold Morse functions exist
    \label{thm:morse_exist}
\end{thm}
\noindent It's not trivial but it can be proven with tools from differential topology.

Example of something we can prove with Morse functions:
\begin{thm}
    \begin{equation}
        \chi(M) = \sum (-1)^k c_k
    \end{equation}
    where $c_k$ is the number of critical points of index $k$.
\end{thm}

\begin{lem}[Morse Lemma II]
    Let $f: M \to \R$, $a< b \in \R$ such that $f$ does not have a critical value in $[a,b]$. Then
    \begin{equation}
        M_a = f^{-1} ((-\infty, a]) \hookrightarrow M_b = f^{-1} ((-\infty, b])
    \end{equation}
    is a deformation retract. In particular, it induces a diffeomorphism $f^{-1}(a) \cong f^{-1}(b)$.
\end{lem}
\begin{rem}
    This uses flow along vector field $\frac{\grad f}{|\grad f|}$. %DRAWING...
\end{rem}

We will restrict to 
\begin{defn}
    A Morse function $f: M \to [a,b]$ is admissibile if $\de M = f^{-1}(a) \cup f^{-1}(b)$ and $a,b$ are regular values.
\end{defn}
% but can I have im f = [a,c] with c<b and f^-1 (c) = emptyset?
The fact that they're regular values is important, since it gives us that a neighborhood of $f^{-1}(a)$ is diffeomorphic to a cylinder $f^{-1}(a) \times [0, \epsilon]$, i.e. a collar (and the same is true for a neighborhood of $f^{-1}(b)$). So an admissible Morse function naturally equips $M$ with the structure of a cobordism from $f^{-1}(a)$ to $f^{-1}(b)$.

Another useful theorem, analogous to \ref{thm:morse_exist} is the following:
\begin{thm}
    Admissible Morse functions exist.
\end{thm}
%TODO add reference to Kosinski Differentiable manifolds.

%tells us how the level set changes before and after the critical point
\begin{thm}([Hi] Theorem 3.2, p.157)
    Let $M^n$ be compact and $f: M \to [a,b]$ an admissible Morse function. Suppose that $f$ has a unique critical value $z$ of index $k$.

    There is an embedding $\iota: D^k \hookrightarrow M$ such that 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $e^k :=  \im \iota \subset M \setminus f^{-1}(b)$, $e^k$ is also called a "belt disk";
        \item $f^{-1}(a) \cap e^k = \de e^k = \iota (\de D^k)$, this is also called a "belt sphere";
        \item $M$ deformation retracts onto $f^{-1}(a) \cup e^k$, this is also called a "$k$-handle".
    \end{itemize}
    %TODO add missing comment on 1-handle, \bar \iota ...., def of H1
    %DRAWINGS
    Moreover, choose an $a'$ with $a<a'< f(z)$, we then have
    \begin{equation}
        M \cong f^{-1}([a,a']) \cup_{\bbar \iota} H^1
    \end{equation}
    (for $n=2$ this is a unique diffeomorphism up to isotopy\footnote{See \ref{Isotopy} for the definition of isotopy.}).
\end{thm}
\begin{ex}
\hfill
    \begin{itemize}
        \item index 0: $M=S^2$ % DRAWING
        we then have $e^0 = \{z\}$, $\iota: D^0={pt} \hookrightarrow M$ and $\bbar \iota: D^0 \times D^2 \hookrightarrow M$.

        But now we can attach in two ways. With a simple band or with a twisted one.
        \item Let's start again with a cylinder and attach a 2-handle $D^2 \times D^0$, so I kind of close one of the two side of the cylinder. %DRAWING
        We see that the 1-handle and the 2-handle kind of cancel each other out!
        \item Analogously, starting with a disk and attaching a 0-handle and then a 1-handle, these also cancel each other out!

\begin{thm}[Hirsch 8.3.4, p. 187]
    Let $M$ be a surface admitting a Morse function that has exactly two critical points. Then
    \begin{equation}
        M \cong S^2
    \end{equation}
\end{thm}
\begin{rem}
    In dimension 1,2 and 3 all the homeomorphic manifolds are also diffeomorphic. 
\end{rem}
\begin{proof}
    Because of the remark it's enough to prove the homeomorphism, rather than the diffeomorphism.

    Assume $p_+, p_- \in M$ are critical points. Since $M$ is compact, also $f(M)$ is compact and therefore has a maximum and a minimum, which exactly correspond to the two critical points. Now assume $p_+$ is the maximum, then $\ind p_+ = 2$. Now, because of Morse Lemma I we have $\exists U_+$ a neighborhood of $p_+$ with coordinates $x_1, x_2$ such that 
    \begin{equation}
        f|_{U_+} = -x_1^2 - x_2^2 + f(p_+)
    \end{equation}
    %DRAWING
    Then we have $\exists b < f(p_+)$ such that $D_+ = f^{-1}([b, +\infty)) \cong D^2$.

    Similarly, $\exists U_-$ a neighborhood of $P_-$ with coordinates $x_1, x_2$ such that 
    \begin{equation}
        f|_{U_-} = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + f(p_-)
    \end{equation}
    and now we have $\exists a > f(p_-)$ such that $D_- = f^{-1}((-\infty,a]) \cong D^2$.

    Let $B_+, B_-$ be disjoint caps around the poles of $S^2$ and denote $C := S^2 \int (B_+ \amalg B_-) \cong S^1 \times [0,1]$. % there was f,x star but I didn't understand TODO
    Now, notice $\de D_+ \cong S^1 \cong \de D_-$ and we have a diffeomorphism $h_0: D_+ \to B_+$ as they are both diffeomorphic to $D^2$. In addition $h_0 |_{\de D_+} \de D_+ \to \de B_+$.
    Notice that between $[a,b]$ there are no critical values, that is $f^{-1}([a,b])$ has no crtiical points
    Now, using Morse Lemma II we get:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $f^{-1}((-\infty, b]) =: M_b \hookrightarrow M_a :=f^{-1}((-\infty, a])$, $f^{-1}(a) \cong f^{-1}(b)$
        \item $f^{-1}([a,b]) \cong f^{-1}(a) \times [0,1] \cong S^1 \times [0,1] $% again f,x star TODO
    \end{itemize}
    Now we can extend $h_0|_{\de D_+}$ to $h_1: \de D_+ \times [0,1] \to \de B_+ \times [0,1]$. Now we can glue $h_0$ and $h_1$
    \begin{equation}
        h: D_+ \cup (\de D_+ \times [0,1]) \to B_+ \cup (\de B_+ \times [0,1]) % TODO add what the two are isomorphic to
    \end{equation}
    \begin{clm}
        If $g: S^1 \to S^1$ is a homeomorphism, then it can be extended to a homeomorphism $\tilde g: D^2 \to D^2$.
    \end{clm}
    $\tilde g$ can simply be defined as follows
    \begin{equation}
        \tilde g(x) = 
        \begin{matrix}
            ||x|| g\left(\frac{x}{||x||}\right)\\
            0   
        \end{matrix}
        \begin{matrix}
            , x\neq 0 \\
            , x =0
        \end{matrix}
        % TODO write piecewise definition
    \end{equation}
    From the claim $h$ can be extended to a homeomorphism $M \to S^2$.
\end{proof}

\begin{rem}
\hfill
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item For any closed $n$ manifold that has two critical points, we have $M \cong S^n$ (\textit{homeomorphic}, not \textit{diffeomorphic}).

$ $ \newline  % to go to a new line after the word proof
    Step 1: Choose an admissible Morse function $f$.
    
    \noindent Step 2a: If necessary, "perturb" $f$ to get distinct critical values. %DRAWING

    \noindent Step 2b: Chop into pieces with exactly one critical point and apply Morse Lemma I. We then get that $f^{-1}((-\infty, a_i])$ is obtained from $f^{-1}((-\infty,a_{i-1}])$ by attaching a handle.

    To prove this there are two strategies:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Use proposition about handle cancellation (first attaching $i$ handle and then $i+1$ handle these cancel) and handle slides: %DRAWING
        with these you can write down an algorithm to get the normal form from any handle decomposition.
        \item One can change the Morse function. Claim: We can choose $f$ such that if $\ind p_1 < \ind p_2 \implies f(p_1) < f(p_2)$. %DRAWING
        This can be proven by changing the Morse function locally around a critical point (see Hirsch for more details). %TODO add ref
    \end{enumerate}

    \noindent Step 4: If $\de M = \emptyset$, then either $M = \emptyset$ or I have at least two critical points.

    Case 1: We have exactly 2 critical points which gives us $M \cong S^2$ because of Lemma. %TODO add ref

    Case 2: If we have $>2$ critical points, look at minimum, then there exist a neighborhood $D_-$ of the minimum such that $D_- \cong D^2$, i.e. a 0 handle attached to $\emptyset$ (because of Morse Lemma I $f$ locally looks like a cup).

    Starting from the minimum, attach one 0-handle. If then we attach another 0-handle, then we can use the handle slides and cancellations to get rid of all 0 handles but one.

    Next we can attach one handles and we have two options, %DRAWING
    only one of which gives an orientable manifold.

    At "end", same argument as for why only one 0-handle read backwards shows that we only have one 2-handle (for example change $f$ to $-f$).
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
    If $M$ is an oriented connected closed surface, it is diffeomorphic to: %DRAWING
\end{thm}

Question: What about the unoriented case? (\textit{Hint: enough to have one attachment of Möbius strip})

%TODO does this go in the proof?
Last step: $ \de M \neq \emptyset$, oriented, connected, then $\de M = S^1 \amalg \dots \amalg S^1$. If $f$ is an admissible Morse function $f$ onto $[a,b]$ with $f^{-1}(a) \cong (S^1)^{\amalg m}$ and $f^{-1}(b) \cong (S^1)^{\amalg n}$. Now one can prove that we don't need neither 0-handles (if $m \neq 0$) nor 2-handles (if $n \neq 0$).

Back to cobordism groups.

We had found 
\begin{align}
    &\Omega_0 \cong \Z_2 \\
    &\Omega_1 \cong 0    \\
    &\Omega_2 \cong \Z_2
\end{align}
and for the oriented case
\begin{align}
    &\Omega_0^{or} \cong \Z \\
    &\Omega_1^{or} \cong 0  \\
    &\Omega_2^{or} \cong 0
\end{align}

\begin{defn}
    A commutative \Z graded ring $S$ is a commutative ring with a grading, i.e. as an abelian group we have $S = \bigoplus_{n \in \Z} S_n$, such that $S_n \cdot S_k \subset S_{n+k}$.
    (elements in $S$ are called \textit{homogeneous of degree n})
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}
    $(\Omega_\bullet = \bigoplus_{n\geq 0} \Omega_n, \amalg, \times)$ is a commutative \Z graded ring.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    Firstly we need to check that the product respects the degree: this is true because $M^m \times N^n = (M \times N)^{m+n}$, so $[M\times N] \in \Omega_{m+n}$.

    Then the products descends to equivalence classes: if $Y_0 \simeq Y_1$ are cobordant via cobordism $(X,p)$ ($p:\de X \to {0,1}$), $M$ any manifold, then $\de X \times M = \de X \times M \xrightarrow{p \circ pr_X} {0,1}$. Therefore $(X \times M, p \circ pr_X)$ is a cobordism from $Y_0 \times M$ to $Y_1 \times M$.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}[Thom]
    There is an isomorphism of \Z graded commutative rings
    \begin{equation}
        \Omega_\bullet \cong \Z_2[x_2, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_8, \dots], \text{ with } \deg x_k = k, k \neq 2^i-1
    \end{equation}
    and the representative of the even degrees are given by $x_{2k} = [\R\P^{2k}]$.
\end{thm}
\begin{rem}
    Note that $(\deg x_2)^2 = \deg 4$ so maybe we could imagine that $\R\P^2 \times \R\P^2 \simeq \R\P^4$ however that's not true since $x_2^2 \neq x_4$.
\end{rem}

There are versions for any "tangential structure", such as orientation or (stable) framing.

\begin{thm}
    There is an isomorphism of \Z graded commutative rings:
    \begin{equation}
        \Omega_\bullet^{or} \otimes \Q \cong \Q[y_4, y_8, y_12, \dots]
    \end{equation}
    with $y_{4k} = [\C\P^{2k}]$. We write it in this way because in this case there is nontrivial torsion. We could also write
    \begin{equation}
        \Omega_\bullet^{or} /\text{torsion} \cong \Z[z_4, z_8, z_12, \dots]
    \end{equation}
    where the representatives are given by Milnor hypersurfaces.
    %stiefel pontryagin classes
\end{thm}
In particular the groups in various degrees are given by:
%TODO add all groups

\begin{equation}

\section{Topological field theories}
\subsection{A modern perspective on cobordisms}
In \ref{Cob Groups} we extracted an algebraic structure from bordisms by first observing that being cobordant is an equivalence relation and then studying the equivalence classes of closed $n-$manifolds. Together with disjoint unions, this resulted in an abelian group, and eventually in a \Z graded commutative ring, and this was a key tool for classifying manifolds up to cobordism. However, this algebraic structure merely records that there is a bordism between two manifolds (since two manifolds are equivalent just if there is a bordism, independently of what kind of bordism it is), thereby forgetting other properties of the bordism itself. We switch now perspective and analyze a more sophisticated structure remembering \underline{how} two manifolds are cobordant, e.g. indicating the direction of the bordism: the symmetric monoidal category $Bord_{n,n-1}$ where objects are $(n-1)-$manifolds and morphisms are $n-$cobordisms. The following table summarizes the comparison between the two perspectives:
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{||c|c||}
    \hline
        $\Omega_n$ & $Bord_{n,n-1}$ \\ [0.5ex]
         \hline\hline
         set & category \\
         \hline
         monoid/group & monoidal category \\
         \hline
         commutative monoid/abelian group & symmetric monoidal category \\
         \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\noindent Analogously to the comparison between the set-theoretic and category-theoretic perspective, we could also have a linear-algebraic perspective. Since an associative algebra on a vector space is the parallel construction to a monoid with set, and a commutative algebra corresponds to a commutative monoid. The following table adds this perspective.
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{||c|c||}
    \hline
        $\Omega_n$ & $Vect_k$ \\ [0.5ex]
         \hline\hline
         set & vector space\\
         \hline
         monoid/group & associative algebra \\
         \hline
         commutative monoid/abelian group & commutative algebra \\
         \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
We make both these comparisons more rigorous by later (\ref{MonObj}) showing that\begin{enumerate}
    \item a monoid is a monoid object in the category of sets
    \item an associative algebra is a monoid object in the category of $k$-vector spaces $Vect_k$
    \item a (\emph{strict}) monoidal category is a monoid object in the category of small categories Cat
\end{enumerate} The same holds for the commutative case, commutative monoids, commutative algebras and (\emph{strict}) symmetric monoidal categories are all examples of commutative monoid objects (see \ref{CommMonObj}).
\subsection{Summary of Category Theory}
\begin{defn}
\label{Cat}
    A locally small\footnote{A category is locally small if every hom $Hom_{\mathscr{C}}(X,Y)$ is not bigger than a set. A locally small category is small if the collection of objects is a set. A large category is a category which is not small. A category is essentially small if it is locally small and the collection of isomorphism classes (collections of isomorphic objects, i.e. objects with a morphism between them which has a left- and right-inverse) is a set. Questions of size of collections play an important role in category theory. For example, one cannot naively take the set of all sets as the collection of objects of the category of sets because of famous set-theoretic paradoxes like Cantor's, Burali-Forti's or Russell's. See \cite{shulman2008set} for an account on possible set-theoretic foundations for category theory.} category $\mathscr{C}$ consists of the following data:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A class $ob(\mathscr{C})$ whose elements are called the \underline{objects of $\mathscr{C}$}
        \item For any $X, Y \in ob(\mathscr{C})$ a set $Hom_{\mathscr{C}}(X,Y)$ whose elements are called \underline{morphisms from $X$ to $Y$}
        \item For any objects $X,Y,Z\in ob(\mathscr{C})$ a map\footnote{Note that we can simply define composition as a map between sets because we are working with a locally small category.}
        
        \begin{gather*}
            Hom_{\mathscr{C}}(Y,Z)\times Hom_{\mathscr{C}}(X,Y)\xrightarrow{\circ} Hom_{\mathscr{C}}(X,Z) \\
            (g,f)\mapsto g\circ f
        \end{gather*}
        which is called \underline{composition} of morpisms
        \item For every object $X\in ob(\mathscr{C})$ an element $id_{X}\in Hom_{\mathscr{C}}(X,X)$ called the \underline{identity} of $X$
    \end{itemize}
    Such data must fulfill the following axioms: \begin{itemize}
        \item $\forall f\in Hom_{\mathscr{C}}(X,Y).f\circ id_{X}=f=id_{Y}\circ f$ \hfill (unitality)
        
        \item $\forall f\in Hom_{\mathscr{C}}(X,Y),g\in Hom_{\mathscr{C}}(Y,Z),h\in Hom_{\mathscr{C}}(W,Z).(h\circ g)\circ f=h\circ (g\circ f)$ \phantom{DDDD} \hfill (associativity)

\begin{ex}\label{Delooping Monoid}
   Let $\mathscr{C}$ be a category with $ob(\mathscr{C})=\{\ast\}$. 
   
  \noindent  Then, $(Hom_{\mathscr{C}}(\ast,\ast),\circ)$ is a monoid since composition is unital with respect to the identity, and hence the identity morphism $id_\ast$ is the neutral element, and associative.
  %TODO I think the notation is usually just BM, not bold--You are probably right but I prefer to put it bold because sometimes it can be confusing, e.g. a bicategory is often denoted by 'B' and then the delooping of a bicategory becomes a one-object tricategory BB. There was also a case I can't remember where one couldn't discern Bs in a topology class. It is true that we'll probably not encounter any such confusing cases but I still prefer it because it shows that it is something "special". having said this, not a big issue for me however, if we change it to just nonbold B /Andrea
  Conversely, every monoid $(M,\cdot)$ defines a category $\mathbf{B}M$ with $$ob(\mathbf{B}M)=\{\ast\},Hom_{\mathbf{B}M}(\ast,\ast)=M,m\circ_{\mathbf{B}M} m'=m\cdot m',id_{\ast}=1_{M}$$ $\mathbf{B}M$ is called the delooping of the monoid $(M,\cdot)$.
    The same holds for groups and one-object groupoids. Every group $(G,\cdot)$ defines a one-object groupoid $\mathbf{B}G$\footnote{We will see a generalization of such deloopings for certain categories, monoidal categories (see \ref{MonCat}) where any monoidal category $\cat$, will be a one-object \emph{bi}category $\mathbf{B}\cat$ called the delooping $\cat$ (see \ref{DeloopingMonCat}).} 

    More generally, monoids of the form $(Hom_\cat(X,X),\circ)$ are called endomorphism monoids and an interesting example thereof is endomorphism monoids in the category $TopVect_k$ of topological vector spaces and continuous linear operators. Such endomorphism monoids $(Hom_{TopVect_{k}}(X,X),\circ)$ and submonoids thereof are called operator algebras. They are important in functonal analysis and in quantum theory.

        \item For every two objects $X,Y\in ob(\mathscr{C})$ a map $$Hom_{\mathscr{C}}(X,Y)\rightarrow Hom_{\mathscr{D}}(F(X),F(Y))$$

Denote with $\pi_0(X)$ the set of equivalence classes of path-connected points, also known as the set of path-connected components, in $X$.

        \item $Hom_{\pi_{\leq 1}(X)}(x,y)$ is given by equivalence classes of continuous paths from $x$ to $y$ that are homotopic\footnote{We later define a homotopy, see \ref{Homotopy}.} relative to their endpoints. We can spell out what this means in the following way
    $$\frac{Hom_{\pi_{\leq 1}(X)}(x,y)=\{\gamma\in Hom_{Top}([0,1],X)|\gamma(0)=x,\gamma(1)=1\}}{\text{homotopy relative to }\de[0,1]}$$

    Given two functors $F,G: \cat \to \mathscr{D}$ a natural transformation from $F$ to $G$, $\alpha : F \Rightarrow G$ is a collection of morphisms indexed by objects in $\cat$, $\alpha_x: F(X) \to G(X)$ such that $\forall f: X\to Y$ in $\cat$ the following diagram commutes

    Note that because of functoriality, if a diagram commutes in $\cat$, then its image under a functor $F:\cat\to\dat$ also commutes in $\dat$. Let for example $g\circ f=h\circ l$, then $F(g)\circ F(f)=F(g\circ f)=F(h\circ l)=F(h)\circ F(l)$

\begin{rem}\label{FunctorGroupoids}
    Note that given a category $\cat$ and a \emph{groupoid} $\dat$, then $\Fun(\cat,\dat)$ is a groupoid since every component of any natural transformation is invertible because they are morphisms in $\dat$ and therefore any natural transformation is a natural isomorphism.

    \label{Cat of representations}
    As we have seen in a previous example \ref{Representations of Groups}, a linear representation of a group $G$ is a functor $\mathbf{B}G\to \Vect_k$. A morphism between $G-$representations $V$ and $W$, $f:V\to W$ is a $k-$linear map which is equivariant, i.e. $\forall g\in G\forall v\in V.f(gv)=gf(v)$. Since linear representations are functors, one might wonder if a morphism between functors $V,W:\mathbf{B}G\to Vect_k$, i.e. a natural transformation, is an equivariant map. Let $f:V\Rightarrow W$ be a natural transformation. Then, for any $g\in Hom_{\mathbf{B}G}(\ast,\ast)$ the following diagram commutes
    \[ \begin{tikzcd}
	{V(\ast)} & {V(\ast)} \\
	{W(\ast)} & {W(\ast)}
	\arrow["{V(g)=g\cdot}", from=1-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow["{f_\ast}"', from=1-1, to=2-1]
	\arrow["{f_\ast}", from=1-2, to=2-2]
	\arrow["{W(g)=g\cdot}"', from=2-1, to=2-2]
\end{tikzcd}\]
    and hence the map is equivariant, it does not matter if we first act on the vector space and subsequently apply the map or viceversa. 
    
    Since one can compose unitally and associatively natural transformations\footnote{By composining their components.}, if we take the collection of all functors $\mathbf{B}G\to \Vect_k$ and the natural transformations between them we get the category of linear representations of the group $G$. Such categories where the objects are functors are called functor categories.

        Let $X,Y\in Top$ and $f,g\in Hom_{Top}(X,Y)$. A homotopy from $f$ to $g$ is a continuous map $$h:[0,1]\times X\to Y$$ such that for every $x\in X$ $h(0,x)=f(x)$ and $h(1,x)=g(x)$. Two maps are homotopic if there is a homotopy between them. 
    Although the homotopy seems intuitively a map between maps, like the natural transformation is, this seems still very far from a natural transformation. However, there is an equivalent formulation of natural transformation: \begin{defn}[Homotopy Analogue of Natural Transformation]
        Let $\Delta^{1}$ be the category with two objects $0,1$ and one non-identity-morphism $u:0\to1$. Given two functors $F,G:\cat\to\dat$ we can see a natural transformation $\tau:F\Rightarrow G$ as a functor $N:\cat\times\Delta^{1}\to\dat$ where $N|_{\cat\times\{0\}}=F$ and $N|_{\cat\times\{1\}}=G$ and thus for every $X\in\cat$, $N(X,0)=F(X)$ and $h(X,1)=G(X)$. This work for the following reason: let $X\xrightarrow{f} Y$ be an arbitrary arrow in $\cat$ and consider this commutative\footnote{It commutes because of unitality in both categories: $f\circ id_X=id_Y\circ f$ and $u\circ id_0=id_1\circ u$.} diagram in $\cat\times\Delta^1$

\begin{defn}[Equivalence of Categories]
    Two categories $\cat$ and $\dat$ are equivalent if and only if there is an equivalence between them.
\end{defn}
\begin{notat}
    We denote that two categories $\cat,\dat$ are equivalent by $\cat\simeq\dat$. Whereas, we write down $\cat\cong\dat$ if they are naturally isomorphic, i.e. there is a natural isomorphism between them. Finding naturally isomorphic categories is very rare.
\end{notat}
\begin{thm}[Fundamental Theorem of Category Theory\footnote{We call it fundamental theorem of category theory following \cite{RezkQuasiCat} to emphasize how important it is. It is central to category theory because it is often very interesting to prove that two categories are equivalent and virtually always one uses the "fully faithful and essentially surjective criterion". This is however an unorthodox denomination because usually such theorem just lacks a name.}]
    Two categories $\cat$ and $\dat$ are equivalent if and only if it there is a fully faithful and essentially surjective functor $F:\cat\to\dat$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
$\implies$
Suppose that there is an equivalence between $\cat\xrightarrow{F}\dat$. Since it is an equivalence, there must be a functor $\dat\xrightarrow{G}\cat$ such that their compositions are naturally isomorphic to the identities on $\cat$ and $\dat$ thanks respectively to natural isomorphisms $\epsilon$ and $\eta$. Thus, for any $Y\in\dat$ there is an object $G(Y)\in\cat$ and an isomorphism $\epsilon_Y:(F\circ G)(Y)\to Y$ making $F$ essentially surjective. To prove the faithfulness of $F$ suppose that there is a pair of parallel arrows $f,g:X\to X'$ in $\cat$ that are mapped by $F$ to the same arrow in $\dat$, i.e. $F(f)=F(g)$, and hence having the following commuting diagram in $\cat$ because of the naturality of $\epsilon$

\end{tikzcd}\]
Note that $G\circ F\overset{\epsilon}{\cong}id_{\mathscr{D}}$, and so $\epsilon_X=id_X$, $\epsilon_{X'}\cong id_{X'}$. We can conclude that  $f=g$: $id_{X'}\circ f=G(F(g))\circ id_X$ and $id_{X'}\circ g=G(F(g))\circ id_X$ because of the commutativity of the latter diagram, thanks to unitality $f=G(F(g))=g$. To prove that $F$ is full take an arbitrary $g:F(X)\to F(X')$ in $\dat$ and consider the following diagram:

	\arrow["{G(F(g{\ast}))}"', shift right=3, from=1-2, to=2-2]
\end{tikzcd}\]
Since we can compose $\epsilon^{-1}_{X'}\circ G(g)\circ \epsilon_X$ there is an arrow $X\to X'$ and it is unique since the diagram commutes by naturality of $\epsilon$, we denote it by $g^{\ast}$. Also because of the commutativity of the latter diagram it must be the case that $G(F(g^{\ast}))=G(g)$ since $G(F(g^{\ast}))=\epsilon^{-1}_{X'}\circ G(g)\circ \epsilon_X=G(g)$. In the first part of the proof we proved the faithfulness of $F$ but by a specular argument, we could have proven the faithfulness of $G$. So, $g=F(g^{\ast})$ and thus $F$ is full. 

\noindent $\impliedby$ For every $Y\in\dat$ there is an isomorphic $F(X)$ because $F$ is essentially surjective and for every $X\in\cat$ there is an isomorphic $G(Y)$ because $G$ is essentially surjective, thus for every $Y\in\dat$ we can \emph{choose} an object $G(Y)\in\cat$ and an isomorphism between them. We denote the isomorphism by $\epsilon_Y:Y\cong F(G(Y))$. In order for $\epsilon_Y$ to be a natural transformation there must be a unique arrow such that for any $f:Y\to Y'$ in  $\dat$ the following diagram commutes 
    % https://q.uiver.app/#q=WzAsNCxbMCwwLCJGKEcoWSkpIl0sWzEsMCwiRihHKFknKSkiXSxbMCwxLCJZIl0sWzEsMSwiWSciXSxbMCwxLCJGKEcoZikpIiwwLHsic3R5bGUiOnsiYm9keSI6eyJuYW1lIjoiZGFzaGVkIn19fV0sWzAsMiwiXFxlcHNpbG9uX1kiLDJdLFsyLDMsImYiLDJdLFsxLDMsIlxcZXBzaWxvbl97WSd9Il1d

	\arrow["{\eta_{Y'}}", from=1-2, to=2-2]
\end{tikzcd}\]
 Then, we get an arrow $\eta_{Y'}^{-1}\circ f\circ\eta_Y:F(G(Y))\to F(G(Y'))$ making the the diagram commute, such an arrow exists because $F$ is full and is unique because $F$ is faithful. We denote it with $F(G(f))$. Now we prove that $G$ is actually a functor. Both $F(G(id_Y))$ and $F(id_{G(Y)})$ make the following diagram commute

Since the diagram commutes $F(G(id_Y))=\eta_{Y}^{-1}\circ id_Y\circ\eta_{Y}=F(id_{G(Y)}$. Moreover, given $f:Y\to Y'$ and $f':Y'\to Y'$ consider the following commutative diagram

By essentially the same argument we just provided for the functoriality of $F$ on the identities we get $F(G(f')\circ G(f))=\eta_{Y''}^{-1}\circ (f'\circ f)\circ\eta_Y=F(G(f'\circ f))$.

Now we just need to prove that there is a natural isomorphism $\epsilon:id_\cat\cong G\circ F$. Since $F$ is full and faithful we can find the components of $\epsilon$ by looking at their image under $F$. We denote $\eta^{-1}_F(X)$ by $F(\epsilon_X)$ and take into consideration a morphism $f:X\to X'$ from $\cat$ and the following commuting outer rectangle

	\arrow["\cong"', from=1-2, to=1-3]
\end{tikzcd}\]
The right hand square commutes because of the naturality of $\eta$. Since the right hand square commutes $F(G(F(f)))=\eta^{-1}_{F(X')}\circ F(f)\circ \eta_{F(X)}$. Since the outer square commmutes $F(\epsilon_{X'})\circ F(f)=\eta^{-1}_{F(X')}\circ F(f)\circ \eta_{F(X)}\circ F(\epsilon_X)$. Thus, the left hand square commutes because $F(\epsilon_{X'})\circ F(f)=F(G(F(f)))\circ F(\epsilon_X)$ and thereby $\epsilon$ is natural because $\epsilon_{X'}\circ f=G(F(f))\circ \epsilon_X$ thanks to the faithfulness of $F$.

\begin{rem}\label{2CatOfAllCats}
    We previously remarked that there is a category of all categories with functors as morphisms (\ref{1CatOfAllCats}). That was however not the end of the story since we also defined a morphism between functors, the natural transformation. Cat is in fact not just a 1-category but a strict 2-category, a category that also has morphisms between morphisms between objects and morphisms between objects compose up to strict equality\footnote{We remark soon after (see \ref{STRICT}) in which sense Cat is a \emph{strict} 2-category. See also for comparison the definition of Bicategory, a weak 2-category, \ref{Bicategory}.}. Morphisms between objects are called 1-morphisms and are functors in the case of $\Cat$. Morphisms between morphisms between objects are called $2$-morphisms and are natural transformations in the case of Cat. 
    \begin{notat}
         An $(n,k)$-category is a category in which all $m$-morphisms with $n\geq m>k$ are invertible and all $j$-morphisms with $j\leq k$ are not necessarily invertible.
    \end{notat}
Folloing this convention an ordinary category is a strict $(1,1)$-category, a strict 2-category is a strict (2,2)-category, a groupoid is a strict (1,0) groupoid, and more generally an $n$-groupoid is an $(n,0)$-category. In order to make this more rigorous we need to loosely characterize enriched categories 
    \begin{defn}[Enriched Category]\label{loose enriched Cat}
        Given a category $\dat$ a category $\cat$ enriched over $\dat$ is a category such that for every $X,Y\in\cat$ $$Hom_{\cat}(X,Y)\in\dat$$
    \end{defn}
    \begin{rem}
        Note that this is just a loose characterization of what an enriched category is! For instance, one might wonder, how could we define the composition map, since for ordinary categories we defined it as a map of sets out of apt \emph{products} of Hom-sets. There is a way to sensibly talk about products of objects in many several other categories. We spell out the rigorous definition later on, see \ref{FullEnrichedCat}. We gave this loose characterization just to be able to characterize higher strict categories.
    \end{rem}
        \begin{ex}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A locally small category is a category enriched over Set
        \item Cat is enriched over Cat, since instead of Homsets one has functor categories, which are themselves categories and hence in Cat. More generally categories with Homcategories/functor categories instead of Homsets are called strict 2-categories, or (2,2)-categories following the convention we just stated.
        \item\label{2,1Grpd} Grpd is enriched over groupoid, since (as we previously remarked, see \ref{FunctorGroupoids}) all natural transformations between functors with a groupoid in the codomain are natural isomorphisms and therefore all functor categories (i.e. the Homobjects of Grpd) are groupoids and hence in Grpd. One calls categories enriched over Grpd strict (2,1)-categories by the notational convention we just spelled out.
    \end{itemize}
    \end{ex}
    
    Having loosely characterized enriched categores We can provide a definition of strict $n$-categories. Following the notational convention we previously spelled out in a previous example, they amount to $(n,n)$-categories.
    \begin{defn}\label{strict nCat}
        We define strict n-categories inductively. A 0-category is a set. A strict $n$-category is a category $\cat$ enriched in a (small\footnote{Because of size issues, as we remarked before, we work with locally small categories and the size of the $Hom$ of any two objects cannot be greater than a set.}) strict $(n-1)$-category. This means that for any two $X,Y\in\cat$, $Hom_{\cat}(X,Y)$ is not a set as usual, but a small strict $(n-1)$-category.
    \end{defn}
    \begin{ex}
    \begin{itemize} \hfill
        \item In the case that $n=1$ we end up with our usual definition of a (locally small) category (see \ref{Cat}).
        \item  $\Cat$ is a $2$-category, in fact for any two $\cat,\dat\in Cat$ $Hom_{\Cat}(\cat,\dat)$ is a $1-$category, more specifically a functor category, i.e. a category where objects are functors and morphisms are natural transformations. $\cat,\dat\in \Cat$ $Hom_{\Cat}(\cat,\dat)=Fun(\cat,\dat)$  
    \end{itemize}
    \end{ex}
\end{rem}
  \begin{rem}\label{STRICT}
        We call such categories, \emph{strict} n-categories because $(n-1)$-morphisms are strictly associative and unital, associativity and unitality hold with strict identities, on the nose. For example in Cat it holds that $\forall F:\cat\to\dat. id_\dat\circ F=F=F\circ id_\cat$ and $\forall F:\cat\to\dat;G:\dat\to\eat;H:\eat\to\bat.H\circ(G\circ F)=(H\circ G)\circ F$ 
    \end{rem}
    We will later encounter a notion of weak 2-category (see \ref{Bicategory}).
\subsubsection{Monoidal Categories}\label{MonCat}
Recall that a monoid is a group where not necessarily every element is invertible: a set $M$ with a distinguished object $e\in M$ called unit, also known as neutral element, and a map of sets $m: M\times M \to M$ such that $m$ is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item associative $$
    \forall a,b,c\in M.m(m(a,b),c)=m(a,m(b,c))
$$
usually written
$$
   \forall a,b,c\in M. (a \cdot b) \cdot c = a\cdot (b \cdot c)
$$
\item and unital with respect to $e$:
$$
     m(e, -) =\id(-), \quad m(-, e) =\id(-)
$$
where $\forall x\in M. id(x)=x$. The latter equation is usually written $$
\forall x\in M.e\cdot x=x=x\cdot e
$$
\end{itemize}
A monoidal category generalizes this structure with respect to objects \emph{and} morphisms of a category.
\begin{defn}
    Let $\cat$ be a category. A monoidal structure on $\cat$ is
    \begin{itemize}
            \item (O) an object $\mathbb{1}_\cat \in \cat$,
            \hfill the \textit{unit}
        \item (M) bifunctor $\otimes: \cat \times \cat \to \cat$, 
            \hfill the \textit{tensor product}
        
        \item (A) a natural isomorphism $\alpha:- \otimes (- \otimes -)\Rightarrow(- \otimes -) \otimes -$ that witnesses associativity:

\end{defn}
\begin{notat}
    As we usually abuse notation and denote monoids $(M,\cdot)$ just with $M$, although a monoid is a set \emph{equipped with} a binary operation; we will denote monoidal categories $(\cat,\otimes,\unit_\cat)$ just with $\cat$, although a monoidal category is a category \emph{equipped with} a monoidal structure.
\end{notat}
\begin{defn}[Strict Monoidal Category]
    A strict monoidal category is a monoidal category where objects and morphisms are associative and unital strictly, not up to specific natural isomorphisms, i.e. the associator and the left/right unitors. This means that for every $f:A,B,C\in\cat$ and every $f:A\to B,g:B\to C,h:C\to D\in\cat$ where $\cat$ is a strict monoidal category: \begin{itemize}
        \item $A\otimes(B\otimes C)=(A\otimes B)\otimes C$
        \item $A\otimes \mathbb{1}_\cat=A=\mathbb{1}_\cat\otimes A$
        \item $f\otimes(g\otimes h)=(f\otimes g)\otimes h$
        \item $f\otimes id_\mathbb{1_cat}=f=id_\mathbb{1_cat}\otimes f$
    \end{itemize}
\end{defn}
\begin{ex}[Examples of \emph{strict} monoidal categories]
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Given an arbitrary category $\cat$, the set\footnote{A set and not a larger collection since we defined categories to be locally small.} of its endofunctors $\End(\cat,\cat)=\Hom_{\Cat}(\cat,\cat)$ are the objects of a monoidal category with and the natural transformations between them their morphisms. The tensor product is given by composition and it is associative since composition of functors is associative. The monoidal unit is $id_\cat$ and is indeed left and right unital. Note however that this is an example of \emph{strict} monoidal category since functors compose strictly and not up to some associator and unitors.
        \item A monoid $(M,\cdot,e)$ is a discrete strict monoidal categories. A discrete category is a category where there are only identity morphisms. So, $(M,\cdot,e)=(\mathcal{M},\otimes,\mathbb{1}_\mathcal{M})$ where $ob(\mathcal{M})=M$ and $\mathbb{1}_\mathcal{M}=e$.
    \end{itemize} 
\end{ex}
\begin{ex}[Examples of monoidal categories]
    Examples of monoidal categories are \begin{itemize}
        \item $(AbGrp, \otimes)$
        \item $(AbGrp, \oplus)$
        \item $(\Vect_k, \otimes)$
        \item $(\Vect_k, \oplus)$

\paragraph{Cartesian Categories}

In particular,
 $(AbGrp, \oplus), (\Vect_k, \oplus), (Set, \times), (Top, \times), (Cat, \times)$ are all examples of special monoidal categories: cartesian monoidal categories. A cartesian monoidal category is a monoidal category where the monoidal structure is given by a suitable notion of cartesian product in such category. We can give a construction valid for every category:
\begin{defn}[Cartesian Product]\label{CartProd}
    Given $A,B\in\cat$, their cartesian product, if it exists, is the tuple $(A\times B,pr_1,pr_2)$, where $A\times B\in ob(\cat)$ and $pr_1:A\times B\to A$  $pr_2:A\times B\to B$ such that for every other object $Y$ with morphisms $f:Y\to A$ and $g:Y\to B$ there is a unique morphism $u:Y\to A\times B$. This definition is summarised by the fact that the following commuting diagram 
    % https://q.uiver.app/#q=WzAsNSxbMSwwLCJZIl0sWzIsMSwiQiJdLFswLDBdLFswLDEsIkEiXSxbMSwxLCJBXFx0aW1lcyBCIl0sWzAsMSwiZyJdLFs0LDMsInByXzEiXSxbMCwzLCJmIiwyXSxbNCwxLCJwcl8yIiwyXSxbMCw0LCJcXGV4aXN0cyEgdSIsMSx7InN0eWxlIjp7ImJvZHkiOnsibmFtZSI6ImRhc2hlZCJ9fX1dXQ==

	\arrow["f"', from=1-2, to=2-1]
	\arrow["{pr_2}"', from=2-2, to=2-3]
	\arrow["{\exists! u}"{description}, dashed, from=1-2, to=2-2]
\end{tikzcd}\]
\end{defn}
If we regard $\cat$ as a specific category such construction gives indeed rise to the expected notion of product in such a category: the cartesian product in $AbGrp$ and $\Vect_k$ is indeed the direct sum, the cartesian product of sets with its projections in $Set$, the product category in $Cat$ and the product of spaces with the product topology in $Top$. 

\begin{lem}
\label{UptoIsoProds}
    Every product is unique up to isomorphism.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose $(A\times B,pr_1,pr_2)$ and $(Y,f,g)$ are both products of $A,B\in\cat$. Then there are unique morphisms $u:A\times B\to Q$ and $u':Q\to A\times B$ such that the following diagram commutes

\end{tikzcd}\]
Since everything commutes $f=f\circ u'\circ u$ and $g=g\circ u'\circ u$. Therefore, $u'\circ u=id_Y$ because $f=f\circ id_Y$ and $g=g\circ id_Y$ and $id_Y$ is the unique morphism such that the latter two equations hold.
\end{proof}
\begin{lem}
    The cartesian product is commutative up to isomorphism.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
    If $(A\times B,pr_1, pr_2)$ and $(B\times A,pr_1, pr_2)$ are both products of $A,B\in\cat$ then, they are isomorphic because of \ref{UptoIsoProds}.
\end{proof}
\begin{lem}
    The cartesian product is associative up to isomorphism.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
    Same reasoning as in the proof of the commutativity of the cartesian product.
\end{proof}
In a cartesian monoidal category $\cat$ the unit is a terminal object, i.e. an object $\ast\in\cat$ to which every object $X\in\cat$ has a unique morphism to it $!_X:X\to\ast$. This is the case because given an arbitrary object $A\in\cat$ and a product with the terminal one $(A\times\ast,pr_1,pr_2)$ the units $\rho:A\times\ast\to A$ and $\lambda:\ast\times A\to A$ are the same projection $pr_1:A\times\ast\to A$ since the cartesian product is commutative. Such projection is indeed an isomorphism because $(A,id_A,!_A)$ is also a product of $\ast,A\in\cat$: any object $Y\in\cat$ with morphisms $f:Y\to A$ and $!_Y\to\ast$ has indeed a unique morphism into $A$ such that the diagram of the product commutes, namely $f$ itself. Thus, since both $(A\times\ast,pr_1,pr_2)$ and $(A,id_A,!_A)$ are products of the same two elements, they must be isomorphic because of \ref{UptoIsoProds}.
Hence, we see how any category with finite cartesian products is a monoidal category. Cartesian monoidal categories are in a sense special because they have some maps which are not possessed by every monoidal category, notably the diagonal map $\Delta_X:X\to X\times X$ and $!_X:X\to\mathbb{1}_\cat$ giving every object a comonoid structure. Moreover, they are all symmetric (defined later, \ref{SymmMonCat}) because the cartesian product is symmetric. 
\paragraph{Noncartesian Monoidal Categories}

\begin{notat}
    We denote the category of abelian groups $\AbGrp$ also with Ab.
\end{notat}
In the previous paragraph, we have talked about cartesian monoidal categories and left out some examples of \emph{noncartesian} monoidal categories like $(AbGrp,\otimes)$ and $(\Vect_k,\otimes)$. We now encounter some examples of noncartesian monoidal categories, which will be central in this class. They will be all similar to $(AbGrp,\otimes)$, so we will first explain this category and then draw parallels with the others. To introduce the tensor product between abelian groups we first have to define what is a bilinear map

\begin{defn}[Bilinear Map]
    For $A,B,C\in \Ab$, a bilinear map, aka group bihomomorphism, is a function $$f:A\times B\to C$$ which is a group homomorphism, aka linear map, in both arguments.
\end{defn}
An explanation of what happens to the elements of $A,B$ might be clearer. Note that a cartesian product $A\times B$ in Ab is an abelian group where the operation is $$(a_1,b_1)+(a_2,b_2)=(a_1+a_2,b_1+b_2)$$ So, we can provide an spell out what it means to be a group bihomomorphism in the folliwing way
\begin{defn}[Bilinear Map via Elements]
    A bilinear map is a function $f:A\times B\to C$ such that for all $a_1,a_2\in A$ and $b_1,b_2\in B$ holds that $$f(a_1+a_2,b_1)=f(a_1,b_1)+f(a_2,b_1)$$ and $$f(a_1,b_1+b_2)=f(a_1,b_1)+f(a_1,b_2)$$
\end{defn}
Having defined what a bilinear map is, we can arrive at the definition of tensor product in Ab
\begin{defn}[Tensor Product of Abelian Groups]
    The tensor product of abelian groups is an endofunctor $\otimes:\Ab\times\Ab\to\Ab$ where $A\otimes B\in\Ab$ has the following universal property: \begin{enumerate}
       \item there is a unique bilinear map $$\phi:A\times B\to A\otimes B$$ $$(a,b)\mapsto a\otimes b$$
       \item any other bilinear map out of $A\times B$, e.g. $h:A\times B\to C$, factors through $\phi$, i.e. there is a linear map $A\otimes B\xrightarrow{\bar{h}}C$ such that $h(a\times b)=\bar{h}(\phi(a,b))=\bar{h}(a\otimes b)$. This means that the following diagram commutes: % https://q.uiver.app/#q=WzAsMyxbMCwwLCJWXFx0aW1lcyBXIl0sWzAsMSwiVlxcb3RpbWVzIFciXSxbMSwwLCJYIl0sWzAsMSwiXFxwaGkiLDJdLFsxLDIsIlxcYmFye2h9IiwyXSxbMCwyLCJoIl1d
\[\begin{tikzcd}
	{A\times B} & C \\
	{A\otimes B}
	\arrow["\phi"', from=1-1, to=2-1]
	\arrow["{\bar{h}}"', from=2-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow["h", from=1-1, to=1-2]
\end{tikzcd}\]
   \end{enumerate}
\end{defn}
It can be equivalently defined via elements.
\begin{defn}[Tensor Product of Abelian Groups via Elements]
    For $A,B\in \Ab$ let $a,a'\in A$ and $b,b'\in B$ then consider the free abelian group on $A\times B$ by the relations $$(a+a',b)-(a,b)-(a',b)$$
    $$(a,b+b')-(a,b)-(a,b')$$ We denote such group by $R$. $A\otimes B$ is then the quotient group on such free group, i.e. $A\otimes B=\frac{A\times B}{R}$.
\end{defn}
Ab is very important as an enriching category. Before, we gave a loose characterization of what an enriched category is by just stating that the $Hom$s are objects of whatever category we are enriching over. However, we glossed over an essential requirement: that the category we are enriching on is actually monoidal because it is necessary to define composition. We now give a fully satisfactory definition of an enriched category
\begin{defn}[Enriched Category]\label{FullEnrichedCat}
    Given a \emph{monoidal} category $\dat$, a $\dat$-enriched category $\cat$, aka $\dat$-category or category enriched over $\dat$, is a category $\cat$ such that \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\forall X,Y\in\cat.Hom_{\cat}(X,Y)\in\dat$ we call $Hom_\cat(X,Y)$ a Hom-object
        \item Composition is a morphism in $\dat$: $$\circ:Hom_\cat(Y,Z)\otimes Hom_\cat(X,Y)\to\Hom_\cat(X,Z)$$ 
        \item For any $X\in\cat$ there is $$id_X:\unit_\dat\to Hom(X,X)$$
        \item There is a Mac-Lane pentagon for Hom-objects in order to specify how $\circ$ is associative and two triangle diagrams in order to pin down how $\circ$ is left and right unital with respect to composable identity morphisms. One can check the spelled out diagram at definition 1.2.34 of \cite{land2021introduction} 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{defn}
\begin{ex}
    \begin{enumerate}\label{Examples of enriched categories (Simplicially)}
        \item A locally small category is a category enriched over Set. Set is a category enriched over itself.
        \item A $2$-category is a category enriched over Cat. Cat is a category enriched over itself, since Cat is a 2-category because $Hom$s are functor \emph{categories}
        \item A strict $n$-category is a category enriched over a strict $(n-1)$-category
        \item A topologically enriched category is a category enriched over Top. The category of compactly generated Hausdorff spaces CGHaus, i.e. a category containing all $CW$-complexes, is a topologically enriched category, since one can take the mapping space $Map(X,Y)$ with the compact-open topology for any $X,Y\in \operatorname{CGHaus}$. Such categories can be used to define ?
        \item A strict $(2,1)$-category is a category in which 2-morphisms are invertible and 1-morphisms not necessarily. It is a Grpd-enriched category. An example of (2,1)-category is Grpd itself, since all $Hom_{\operatorname{Grpd}}$ are indeed  groupoids (see \ref{2,1Grpd} for an explanation). 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{ex}
There is another example of strict (2,1)-category from topology and it will let us rigorously show in which sense a homotopy is a natural transformations and why one might want to talk about $\infty$-categories.
\paragraph{Outlook: Grothendieck's Homotopy Hypothesis and $\infty$-categories}
    \begin{ex}\label{Homotopy2Top}
    We previously spelled out an analogue formulation of the natural transformation (see \ref{Homotopy}). This shows that the notion of homotopy and natural transformation are related. A way to more rigorously pin down that a homotopy is some kind of natural transformation is via the the homotopy 2-category of topological spaces. Instead of taking paths up to homotopies between paths, as in the more famous hTop, we take homotopies between paths up to homotopies between homotopies between paths. This results in a strict (2,1)-category 2-hTop where objects are topological spaces, 1-morphisms are continuous maps and 2-morphisms are homotopies between continuous maps up to higher homotopies, i.e. homotopies between homotopies between continuous maps. A homotopy between a homotopy between continuous maps is defined in the following manner: given continuous functions $f,g:X\to Y$ and homotopies between them $k,h:X\times [0,1]\to Y$, a homotopy $L$ between these two homotopies $k$ and $h$ is a continuous function $L:X\times [0,1]\times[0,1]\to Y$ such that \begin{itemize}
            \item $\forall t\in [0,1]\forall x\in X. H(0,t,x)=h(t,x)$
            \item $\forall t\in [0,1]\forall x\in X. H(1,t,x)=k(t,x)$
            \item $\forall t'\in [0,1]\forall x\in X. H(t',0,x)=f(x)$
            \item $\forall t'\in [0,1]\forall x\in X. H(t',1,x)=g(x)$
        \end{itemize}
        If one takes topological spaces as objects, continuous maps between them as 1-morphisms, and homotopies between continuous maps \emph{up to} homotopies between homotopies one gets the homotopy 2-category of topological spaces 2-hTop and is an example of a strict $(2,1)$-category. If one restricts themselves to spaces admitting the structure of CW-complexes, i.e. something like weakly Hausdorff compactly generated spaces, and then take the homotopy 1-types thereof, we get a subcategory of 2-hTop called 2-1Type. Via the Eilenberg-MacLane space of a groupoid one can establish an equivalence of categories 
$$2\operatorname{-}1Type\simeq Grpd$$
This is Grothendieck's infamous homotopy hypothesis in dimension 1. It was formulated in \emph{Pursuing Stacks} in full generality for $\infty$-groupoids. We now sketch how this works in full glory.
    \end{ex}
    \begin{notat}
        By $\infty$-category we mean $(\infty,1)$-category.
    \end{notat}
\begin{ex}\label{HomotopyHypothesis} Regarding the last example, one could ask why stop at homotopies between homotopies and not go all the way to homotopies between homotopies between homotopies, homotopies between ... for $\infty$ many times? This is a great question and also the way to provide a universal properties for constructions similar to the already seen cartesian product called homotopy co/limits (for more on this see chapters 1 and 2 of \cite{HarpazAlgebras}). In the end, one would get an $(\infty,1)$-category, a category in which the only morphisms that are not necessarily (weakly\footnote{To be precise, higher morphisms in such a category are weakly invertible and not strictly. This is not at all bad and that things are not strict but up to homotopy/equivalence is exactly what one desires in this context. Weakly invertible means that it is not the case the sense that $f\circ g=id$, but $f\circ g\simeq id$}.) invertible are morphisms between objects, all other morphisms between morphisms are invertible; in other words, a category in which all $n>1$-morphisms are invertible and 1-morphisms not necessarily. 

Moreover, one gets the fundamental $\infty$-groupoid of a space via a similar reasoning: instead of considering paths up to homotopies between paths, one can go all the way up and consider homotopies between homotopies between... without forgetting any information. All paths and all homotopies are clearly invertible so for all $k\in \mathbb{N}_0$ all $k$-morphisms are invertible and that is why it is called $\infty$-\emph{groupoid}. A synonym for $\infty$-groupoid is $(\infty,0)$-category. Note that the category of all $\infty$-groupoids is not an $\infty$-groupoids, because functors are between $\infty$-groupoids are not necessarily invertible, parallelly to functors between 1-groupoids. The previously mentioned homotopy hypothesis states that the $(\infty,1)$-category of (nice) topological spaces we just sketched is equivalent to the $(\infty,1)$-category of $\infty$-groupoids. The intuition behinds this is that this should hold thanks to the construction of fundamental $\infty$-groupoids of spaces, whereas, in the other direction, from $\infty$-groupoids one can construct spaces via something called the geometric realization. This equivalence is the reason why in the literature the category of $\infty$-groupoids is sometimes called the category of Spaces. If the equivalence holds or not of course depends on how we define 'space' and $\infty$-groupoid, but it holds for many reasonable definitions. 

One way to model this kind of categories with infinitely many invertible morphisms is with topologically enriched categories, which we previously described, since one can mapping spaces are Hom-objects, continuous functions between mapping spaces induce 1-morphisms between objects and higher morphisms are given by the homotopies between such mapping spaces. 

A further way is via some specific simplicially enriched categories, i.e. categories enriched with the cartesian monoidal category of simplicial sets sSet (sometimes denoted Set$_\Delta$). A synonym of simplicially enriched category is simplicial category. 
        \begin{defn}[The Simplex Category]
    We call simplex category, the category with all linearly ordered sets $[n]$ as objects and weakly monotonic maps as morphisms. We denote such category with $\Delta$.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}[Simplicial Set]
    A simplicial set is a Set-valued presheaf on $\Delta$, i.e. a functor $X:\Delta^{\operatorname{op}}\to \Set$. Simplicial sets form a functor category where morphisms are natural transformations denoted sSet. It is bicomplete, see the proof in \cite[1.1.24]{land2021introduction}
\end{defn}
However, we do not want simplicial sets in general, but simplicial sets that are Kan complexes\footnote{See \url{https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Kan+complex}.}. This is because these special simplicial sets give a geometric model of $\infty$-groupoids and hence if we enrich a category via such simplicial sets, we get the desired $(\infty,1)$-category, similarly to getting (2,1)-categories by enriching with ordinary groupoids.

Quasi-categories are another construction to model $\infty$-categories that has been proven very useful and apt to create useful constructions. It also relies heavily on simplicial sets and there is strong connection to simplicially enriched categories\footnote{See \cite{land2021introduction}.}.

These three different ways to model $\infty$-categories are equivalent in some apt sense (see \cite{LurieGoodwillieEquivalent} and \cite{bergner2006survey}).

        \begin{rem}
            Another important example of $(\infty,1)$-category is the category of spectra, a category similar\footnote{Abelian Groups:Algebra$\sim$Spectra:Higher Algebra, for more on this check out \cite{Mazel-Gee2024}.} to the category of abelian groups which we will encounter later (see \ref{Spectra Phases of Matter}).
        \end{rem} 
\end{ex}
\paragraph{Back to Enriched Categories}
Having characterized satisfactorily enriched categories we can now define what is an Ab-enriched category.
\begin{defn}[Ab-Category]\label{Ab-Enriched Cat}
An Ab-category, aka ringoid, Ab-enriched, $\cat$ is a category $\cat$ enriched over Ab. This is equivalent
to saying that
\begin{enumerate}
        \item $\forall X,Y\in\cat.Hom_{\cat}(X,Y)\in\Ab$
        \item Composition is a morphism in $\Ab$: $$+:Hom_\cat(Y,Z)\otimes_{\Ab} Hom_\cat(X,Y)\to\Hom_\cat(X,Z)$$ such that it is associative and unital with respect to composable identity morphisms; in short $Hom$-objects of $\cat$ posses an abelian structure with + as a binary operation
        \item The composition of the underlying $Hom$-\underline{sets} is bilinear with respect to $+$, meaning that $\circ$ of $Hom$-sets distributes over $+$ of $Hom$-abelian groups i.e. $$f\circ(g+h)=(f\circ g)+(f\circ h)$$ $$(f+g)\circ h=(f\circ h)+(f\circ h)$$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

\begin{ex}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A ring is a one object ringoid. More explicitly, a ring $(R,\cdot,+)=(Hom_{\mathbf{B}R}(\ast,\ast),\circ,+)$  
        \item Ab is an Ab-category.
    \end{itemize}
\end{ex}
\begin{rem}
    These categories are very important for homological algebra, a field with important applications to many fields, e.g. algebraic geometry (in particular intersection theory) and algebraic topology. The standard reference is \cite{weibel1994introduction}, check out part I of \cite{Mazel-Gee2024} for a modern introduction to the subject geared towards higher categorical generalizations. Such higher categorical generalizations are of major interest to us in the context of TFTs, we will later sketch for example how they can be used to calculate topological phases of matter (\ref{Spectra Phases of Matter}). 
\end{rem}
Another very important example for us of noncartesian\footnote{Interestingly, the fact that $\Vect_k$ is not cartesian and in particular $Hilb_\mathbb{C}$ (the category of complex Hilbert spaces) is the main reason behind the no-cloning theorem from quantum information theory, more on this in \cite{baez2004quantum}. This characterizing non-cartesian aspect is nicely summarized by Freed in \cite{freed2012cobordism}, "We will see that a characteristic property of quantum systems is that disjoint unions map to tensor products. The passage from classical to quantum is (poetically) a passage from addition to multiplication, a kind of exponentiation."} monoidal category is $(\Vect_k,\otimes)$
\begin{defn}[Tensor Product between Vector Spaces]
    The tensor product is usually defined from bases (see \hyperlink{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_product}{wikipedia entry on tensor product}) or via quotient spaces\footnote{We use the definition via quotient spaces because it is easier to see that it fulfills the equivalent one via universal properties and the cartesian product.} along these lines: let $V,W\in \Vect_K$. Consider $L$, a vector space that has $V\times W$ as basis. Let $R$ be the subspace whose elements are linear combinations of one of the following forms
    $$(v+v',w)-(v,w)-(v',w)$$
    $$(v,w+w')-(v,w)-(v,w')$$
    $$(kv,w)-k(v,w)$$
    $$(v,kw)-k(v,w)$$
    where $v,v'\in V$, $w,w'\in W$ and $k\in K$. The tensor product is then the quotient space $L/R=V\otimes W$, where the image $(v,w)$ in this quotient is denoted by $v\otimes w$.

   \noindent The cartesian product construction helps us find an equivalent definition the tensor product is an endofunctor $\otimes:\Vect_K\times\Vect_K\to\Vect_K$ where $V\otimes W$ has the following universal property: \begin{enumerate}
       \item there is a unique bilinear map out of the cartesian product of the underlying sets $\phi:V\times W\to V\otimes W$
       \item any other bilinear map out of the cartesian product of the underlying sets $h:V\times W\to X$ factors through $\phi$:% https://q.uiver.app/#q=WzAsMyxbMCwwLCJWXFx0aW1lcyBXIl0sWzAsMSwiVlxcb3RpbWVzIFciXSxbMSwwLCJYIl0sWzAsMSwiXFxwaGkiLDJdLFsxLDIsIlxcYmFye2h9IiwyXSxbMCwyLCJoIl1d
\[\begin{tikzcd}

	\arrow["{\bar{h}}"', from=2-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow["h", from=1-1, to=1-2]
\end{tikzcd}\]
   \end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

As with Ab, $\Vect_k$ can also be used as enriching category
\begin{defn}
     A linear category $\cat$, or algebroid, is a category enriched over $\Vect_k$
\end{defn}
   
\begin{ex}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A $k$-algebra is a one object algebroid.
        \item $\Vect_k$ is a linear category, since also $Hom_{\Vect_{k}}(X,Y)$ is a vector space
    \end{itemize}
\end{ex}

More generally the category of modules is also a very important example of noncartesian monoidal category 
\begin{defn}[Module]\label{CatOfModules}
    
\end{defn}
\begin{ex}
    The category of bimodules is an example of symmetric monoidal category
    \begin{defn}[Bimodule]\label{CatOfBimodules}
        
    \end{defn}
\end{ex}
Another example of non-cartesian monoidal category, which is not algebraic in nature but topological and will be useful for an outlook in the next section is the category of disks.
\begin{ex}\label{CatOfDisks}
    The category of oriented 1-dimensional open disks Disk$^{or}_{1}$ is also an important example of symmetric monoidal category for us in the context of TFTs. Recall that $D^1\cong (0,1)\cong\R$. \begin{itemize}
        \item Its objects are finite disjoint unions of 1-dimensional open disks $$\emptyset,\qquad\R,\qquad\R\amalg\R,\qquad\dots,\qquad\R^{\amalg k}$$ with $k\in\N$ arbitrary
        \item $Hom_{\text{Disk}^{or}_{1,0}}(X,Y)$ consists of all smooth embeddings $j:X\hookrightarrow Y$, i.e. $X$ is diffeomorphic onto its image, respecting orientations
        \item The tensor product is given by the disjoint union where given $X$ a disjoint union of $n$ oriented 1-disks and $Y$ a disjoint union of $m$ oriented 1-disks, $X\amalg Y$ is a disjoint union of $n+m$ oriented disks 
        \item The unit is the empty set since given an arbitrary disjoint union of disks $X$, $\emptyset\amalg X\cong X\cong X\amalg\emptyset$
        \item There is a diffeomorphism $X\amalg Y\cong Y\amalg X$ making Disk$^{or}_{1,0}$ a \emph{symmetric} monoidal category
    \end{itemize}  We will use it to give an equivalent definition of $k$-algebra (see \ref{EAlg}), but in general they can be used to define factorization algebras, a very important tool in the field of TFTs, see \cite{Tanaka_2020}.
\end{ex}
\paragraph{Objects Internal to a Monoidal Category}
\begin{defn}[Monoid Object]
    A monoid object in a monoidal category $\cat$ is an object $M\in\cat$ equipped with two distinguished morphisms, $\mu:M\otimes M\to M$ and $\eta:\mathbb{1}_\cat\to M$ called respectively multiplication and unit such that the following diagram commutes, so that the binary operation associative

    and the following also commutes, so that the binary operation is left and right unital

    Making multiplication associative and unital.
\end{defn}
\begin{ex}\label{MonObj}
A monoid object is a 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Monoid when in $(Set,\times)$
        \item Algebra when in $(\Vect_k,\otimes)$
        \item Algebra when in $(BMod,\otimes)$
        \item \emph{Strict} monoidal category when in $(Cat,\times)$
        \item Topological monoids in $(Top,\times)$
    \end{itemize}
\end{ex}
This example clarifies the parallel between monoids, algebras and monoidal categories we made at the start of this section. However, one could be bothered by the fact that we do not actually get a general monoidal category (i.e. not necessarily strict). To do this we will need to talk about $E_1$-algebras.

\paragraph{Outlook towards $\mathbb{E}_n$-Algebras}
\begin{defn}[Isotopy]\label{Isotopy}
    An isotopy is a stricter form of homotopy. Let $f,g:X\to Y$ be embeddings. Then $H:X\times [0,1]\to Y$ is an isotopy if 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $H(0,-)=f$
        \item $H(1,-)=g$
    \end{itemize}
    thereby making an isotopy a homotopy and
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\forall t\in[0,1].H(t,-)\hookrightarrow Y$ is an embedding
    \end{itemize}
    Moreover, if $f,g$ are \emph{smooth} embeddings and $\forall t\in[0,1].H(t,-)\hookrightarrow Y$ is also a smooth embedding, then $H$ is a \emph{smooth} isotopy
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[$\mathbb{E}_1$-Algebra]\label{EAlg}
    Let $Disk_{1,0}^{or}$ be the category of 1-disks (see \ref{CatOfDisks}). Then a $\mathbb{E}_1$-algebra is a symmetric monoidal functor $$Disk_{1}^{or}\to \cat$$ such that if $j,i\in Hom_{Disk_{1}^{or}}(X,Y)$ are smoothly isotopic embeddings, then  $F(j)=F(i)$, i.e. they are sent to the same morphism in $\cat$. More generally..
\end{defn}
\begin{thm}
  $\mathbb{E}_1$-algebras with $\Vect_k$ as a target category correspond to $k$-algebras. Look into \cite{Tanaka_2020} for a sketch of the proof.
\end{thm}
\begin{thm}
    $\mathbb{E}_1$-algebras with $\Cat$ as a target category are monoidal categories.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    %TBD /Andre
\end{proof}
We summarize the correspondence with the following table
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|}
    \hline
        \phantom{h} & Set & $\Vect_k$ & Cat \\ [0.5ex]

         $\mathbb{E}_1$-algebra & monoid & $k$-algebra & monoidal category  \\
         \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\begin{rem}
    Remember that a monoid object in Cat is a \emph{strict} monoidal category. Via $\mathbb{E}_1$-algebras is instead the way to precisely pin down the correspondence we laid down at the start of the section between monoidal categories, $k$-algebras and monoids, without collapsing monoidal categories to \emph{strict} monoidal category, as we did with the monoid object.
\end{rem} 
\paragraph{Back to Monoid objects}
\begin{defn}[Morphism of Monoids]

    Let $M\in\cat$, $M$ together with a comultiplication $\Delta$ and a counit $\epsilon$ is a comonoid object iff $(M,\mu,\eta)$ a monoid object in $\cat^{op}$ (see \ref{CatOP}) such that $\mu=\Delta^{op}$ and $\eta=\epsilon^{op}$. Straightforwardly, the definition we gave for monoid object, but with all the arrows inverted. 
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Bimonoid Object]\label{BimonObj}
    A bimonoid object in a monoidal category $\cat$ is simultaneously a monoid and a comonoid object in $\cat$ in a compatible way. It has a unit $\eta:\mathbb{1}_\cat\to M$ and a counit $\epsilon:\cat\to\mathbb{1}_\cat$, a multiplication $\mu:M\otimes M\to M$ and and a comultiplication $\Delta:M\to M\otimes M$ such that comultiplication and multiplication are morphisms of monoids. In the case of comultiplication, this means that given a monoid object $(M\otimes M,\mu',\eta')$ with $\mu':(M\otimes M)\otimes(M\otimes M)\to M\otimes M$ and $\eta':M\otimes M\to \mathbb{1}_\cat$  both the following diagrams commute

\paragraph{Symmetric Monoidal Categories}
In order to get the categorical parallel of a commutative monoid, we need to define a \emph{symmetric} monoidal category. We want to achieve something similar to $a \cdot b = b \cdot a$ in a monoid. However, we will not characterize this behavior with strict identities\footnote{As we did not define associativity and unitality with strict identities but with natural isomorphisms.}, but with a natural isomorphism. Given the functor 
$$swap:\cat\to\cat$$
$$swap:(X,Y)\mapsto (Y,X)$$
$$swap:(f,g)\mapsto (g,f)$$
we could try to achieve our objective with a natural isomorphism $\beta:\otimes\to\otimes\circ swap$ that can be visualized in the category of all categories Cat with the following diagram

% https://q.uiver.app/#q=WzAsMixbMCwwLCJcXGNhdFxcdGltZXNcXGNhdCJdLFsxLDAsIlxcY2F0Il0sWzAsMSwiXFxvdGltZXMiLDAseyJjdXJ2ZSI6LTN9XSxbMCwxLCJcXG90aW1lc1xcY2lyYyBzd2FwIiwyLHsiY3VydmUiOjN9XSxbMiwzLCJcXGJldGEiLDAseyJzaG9ydGVuIjp7InNvdXJjZSI6MjAsInRhcmdldCI6MjB9fV1d

	\arrow["\beta", shorten <=5pt, shorten >=5pt, Rightarrow, from=0, to=1]

However, this does not characterize an actually symmetric structure, but rather a \textit{braiding}, meaning that inverting two times the order of two tensor multiplied elements, i.e. objects or morphisms, does not necessarily equal the non-inverted tensor multiplied elements. What this means will become clearer with the example of the braid group and the definition of symmetric monoidal category.

    A braiding on a monoidal category is a natural transformation $\beta$ with components $\beta_{X,Y}:X\otimes Y\Rightarrow Y\otimes X$

    The latter two diagrams are known as the hexagon diagrams. We call such categories braided monoidal.
\end{defn}
\begin{ex}
    The braid group:

\end{ex}
A braided monoidal category is not the category corresponding to an abelian monoid. A special type of braided monoidal category is: the symmetric monoidal category.
\begin{defn}
\label{SymmMonCat}
    A symmetric monoidal category is a braided monoidal category $(C, \otimes, 1, \alpha, \lambda, \rho,\beta)$ such that $\beta^2 = id$ (i.e. $(\beta_{y,x} \circ \beta_{x,y} = id)$).
\end{defn}
\begin{ex}
    \begin{itemize} \hfill
        \item All the previous examples of monoidal categories! $(\Vect, \oplus), (AbGrp, \otimes), \dots$
        \item Importantly for us the category of bimodules $BMod$
        \item The category of algebras over a module
    \end{itemize}
\end{ex}
\begin{thm}[MacLane's coherence theorem]
    In any monoidal category, any formal diagram, i.e. a diagram made up just of associators, unitors (and braidings, in the case of braided and symmetric monoidal categories) commutes.
\end{thm}
We do not provide the proof here but refer to chapter 7 of \cite{Lane1971}.
The analogy in a monoid is that it does not make a difference however I put my parentheses:
    $$(a_1 a_2) ((a_3 a_4) a_5) = ((a_1 (a_2 a_3)) a_4) a_5$$
but instead of an equality we have objects equivalent up to isomorphisms given by associators, unitors, etc... note that we could have more than one way to compose unitors, e.g. in the diagram we previously imposed as conditions, but these will all form a commutative diagram and hence be equivalent.

Earlier on we defined a monoid object (\ref{MonObj}), in a symmetric monoidal object, we can also define a commutative monoid object.
\begin{defn}[Commutative Monoid Object]\label{CommMonObj}
    A commutative monoid object, is a monoid object in a symmetric monoidal category for which additionally the following diagram commutes

    Let $(M,\Delta,\epsilon)$ be a comonoid object (\ref{ComonObj}) in a symmetric monoidal category $\cat$. It is cocommutative iff $(M,\mu,\eta,\beta_{M,M})$ a commutative monoid object in $\cat^{op}$ (see \ref{CatOP}) such that $\mu=\Delta^{op}$, $\eta=\epsilon^{op}$ and $\beta_{M,M}^{op}=\beta_{M,M}$. Straightforwardly, the definition we gave for commutative monoid object, but with all the arrows inverted. 
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}[Commutative Bimonoid Object]\label{CommBim}
    A commutative bimonoid object in a symmetric monoidal category $\cat$ is a bimonoid object (\ref{BimonObj}) such that the underlying monoid object is  commutative. Note that the underlying comonoid object is cocommutative id and only if the underlying monoid object is commutative.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}[Commutative Frobenius Algebra]\label{CommFrobAlg}
    A commutative Frobenius algebra in a symmetric monoidal category $\cat$ is a commutative bimonoid where the Frobenius relation holds, i.e. $$(\mathbb{1}_\cat\otimes\mu)\circ(\Delta\otimes\mathbb{1}_\cat)=\Delta\circ\mu=(\mu\otimes\unit_\cat)\circ(\unit_\cat\otimes\Delta)$$
\end{defn}
We need a notion of homomorphism between symmetric monoidal categories, a suitable definition of functor. 
\begin{defn}\label{SymmMonFun}
    Let $\mathscr{B},\cat$ be symmetric monoidal categories. A symmetric monoidal functor is a functor $F: \mathscr{B} \to \cat$ compatible with all of the structure:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item an isomorphism taking the monoidal unit in $\cat$ to the monoidal unit in $\mathscr{B}$: $\phi:\mathbb{1}_\cat \xrightarrow{1_F} F(\mathbb{1}_\mathscr{B})$

it interacts well with the unit\footnote{We just need the diagram for one unit since in a symmetric monoidal category $\lambda=\rho$.

\end{defn}
This notion will be one a central notion in this course since a TFT is just a symmetric monoidal functor with a special domain: the cobordism category (See the next subsection \ref{CobCat}).

We also need a suitable notion of natural transformation between symmetric monoidal functors.
\begin{defn}[(Symmetric) Monoidal Natural Transformation]\label{SymmMonNat}

No other conditions are needed to be specified for a symmetric monoidal natural transformation, a monoidal natural transformation between symmetric monoidal functors. 
\begin{ex}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let $\Z[-]:Set\to AbGrp$ be the free functor\footnote{A free functor is a left adjoint to the forgetful functor.} generating free groups from sets. Define $\Z[-\times-]:Set\to AbGrp$, the free functor generating free groups out of cartesian products in $Set$, and $\Z[-]\otimes\Z[-]$, the free functor first generating free groups and then tensor-multiply them with the tensor product in $AbGrp$.  There is a monoidal natural isomorphism $\alpha$ between them, $\forall A,B\in Set.\Z[A\times B]\cong\Z[A]\otimes\Z[B]$. The notation $\Z[-]$ comes from the fact that abelian groups are exactly free modules on the integers, the categories of abelian groups and of modules on the integers are not just equivalent categories, but naturally isomorphic, something very rare.
    \item Let $V\in\Vect_k$. Then $V\to V^{\ast\ast}$ are the components of...
    \item The determinant...
    \item There is a monoidal natural isomorphism between $id_{Grp}$ and $Grp\xrightarrow{op} Grp$, $G\mapsto G^{op}$, the functor sending every group $(G,\ast)$ to its opposite group, i.e. $(G^{op},\ast^{op})$, where $a\ast^{op}b=b\ast a$.
\end{itemize}
\end{ex}
\begin{rem}
    One way in which (symmetric) monoidal natural transfomations are important is that they let us define a suitable notion of equivalence between (symmetric) monoidal categories. This will be fundamental in a forthcoming section (\ref{ClassificationOfTFTs}).
\end{rem}
\begin{defn}[Monoidal Equivalence]
    There is a (symmetric) monoidal equivalence between (symmetric) monoidal categories $\cat$ and $\dat$ if and only if there are (symmetric) monoidal functors $F, G:\mathscr{D}\rightarrow\mathscr{C}$ and (symmetric) monoidal natural isomorphisms $G\circ F\overset{\epsilon}{\cong}id_{\mathscr{C}}$ and $F\circ G\overset{\eta}{\cong}id_{\mathscr{D}}$.
\end{defn}
\begin{rem}\label{CatSymmMonCat}
    There is a strict 2-category SymmMonCat similar to Cat (see \ref{2CatOfAllCats}), where 1-morphisms are symmetric monoidal functors and 2-morphisms are symmetric monoidal natural transformations. 
\end{rem}
\begin{notat}
    Note that then $Hom_{\SymmMonCat}(\cat,\dat)$ is a special functor category. A functor category where objects are symmetric monoidal functors. An alternative way to denote $Hom_{\SymmMonCat}(\cat,\dat)$ is $Fun^{\otimes}(\cat,\dat)$.
\end{notat}
We have previously seen (\ref{Representations of Groups}) that a linear representation of a group $G$ is just a functor $\mathbf{B}G\rightarrow \Vect_k$. More generally, some, e.g. \cite[p. 34 ]{kock_2003}, give a definition of linear representation for symmetric monoidal categories: 
\begin{defn}[Linear Representation]\label{LinReprCat}
    Let $\cat$ be a symmetric monoidal category. A linear representation of such category is a symmetric monoidal functor $$\cat\to\Vect_k$$ Such functors are the objects of the category of representation of $\cat$ whereas symmetric monoidal natural transformations are the morphisms, $Rep(\cat)=Fun^{\otimes}(\cat,\Vect_k)$
\end{defn}
\paragraph{Outlook: Interlude on Bicategories}
%I hope the order here is not confusing, in the sense that why not define before a bicategory and subsequently the delooping, however this sequence where one first pictures the delooping and then they picture a bicategory made sense in my mind. Feel free to change /Andrea
%Also I hope it is not overkill, it all started because I wanted to define dual objects of a monoidal cat as adjunctions of 1-morphisms in the delooping, then realized that bicategory would be useful also for 2 reasons: 1-understanding better why Cat is strict and not weak, and in general picturing what weak n-categories are and 2-the extended 2-category of 2 dimensional bordisms is a bicategory. I'll ask the professor if it makes sense or it is just confusing
\begin{defn}[Delooping of a Monoidal Category]\label{DeloopingMonCat}
    Let $\cat$ be a monoidal category. The delooping category $\mathbf{B}\cat$ is a one object $2$-category with: \begin{itemize}
        \item $ob(\mathbf{B}\cat)=\ast$
        \item $1-mor(\mathbf{B}\cat)=ob(\cat)$
        \item $2-mor(\mathbf{B}\cat)=mor(\cat)$
    \end{itemize}
    Composition of $2$-morphisms is given by the usual composition of morphisms between objects in $\cat$. The composition of $1$-morphisms is given by the tensor product. This makes sense since there is a monoidal unit $\mathbb{1}_\cat$ that works as the identity arrow for any object, since it is left and right unital for any object and the tensor product is associative. However, in monoidal categories associativity and unitality hold up to isomorphism and this is witnessed by the associator and left/right unitors!
\end{defn}
\begin{rem}
    Notice that the delooping $\mathbf{B}\cat$ is generally not a $2$-category in the same sense that Cat and SymmMonCat are. $1$-morphisms compose strictly in $\Cat$, "on the nose", i.e. $F\circ(G\circ H)=(F\circ G)\circ H$ and $F\circ id_\cat =F=id_\dat\circ F$; whereas $1$-morphisms in $\mathbf{B}\cat$ compose up to natural isomorphism, more precisely up to the associator and left/right unitors.
\end{rem}
\begin{defn}[Bicategory]\label{Bicategory}
    A bicategory $\bat$ consists of \begin{itemize}
        \item A collection of objects $ob(\bat)$, whose elements $X,Y,Z$ are also called 0-cells
        \item For each objects $X,Y$, a 1-category $Hom_\bat(X,Y)$, whose objects $f,g,\dots$ are called 1-cells or 1-morphisms and whose morphisms $\alpha,\beta,\dots$ are called 2-cells or 2-morphisms; composition of (2-)morphisms in this category is also called vertical composition
        \item For any three objects $X,Y,Z$ there are composition functors, also called horizontal composition $$\circ_{X,Y,Z}:Hom(Y,Z)\times Hom(X,Y)\to Hom(X,Z)$$
        $$(f,g)\mapsto f\circ g$$
        $$(\alpha,\beta)\mapsto \alpha\circ\beta$$ in the context of bicategories we denote composition of functors with $\bigcirc$ instead of the usual $\circ$ in order to not get confused between a composition functor and a composition of functors
        \item  For every object $X$ there is an identity functor from the one-object category\footnote{This is the terminal object of Cat and thereby monoidal unit of the cartesian monoidal category $(\Cat,\times,\unit_{\Cat})$ with the cartesian product as the tensor product. With $ob(\unit_{\Cat})=\{\ast\}$ and $Hom_{\Cat}(\ast,\ast)=id_{\ast}$.} $\unit_{\Cat}$
        $$identity_X:\unit_{\text{Cat}}\to Hom(X,X)$$ $$\ast\mapsto id_X$$ we name the image of the single object the identity 1-morphism, i.e. $identity_{X}(\ast)=id_X$
        \item There are natural isomorphisms $a,r,l$ expressing associativity and unitality of the composition functor: \begin{itemize}
            \item associativity, as a natural isomorphism in Cat $$a:\circ_{W,X,Y}\bigcirc(\circ_{X,Y,Z}\times id_{Hom(W,X)})\xRightarrow{\cong}(id_{Hom(Y,Z)}\times id_{W,X,Y})\bigcirc \circ_{W,Y,Z}$$
            given $h:W\to X$, $f:X\to Y$ and $g:Y\to Z$, $a$ is a 2-isomorphism in $\bat$
            $$a_{g,f,h}:g\circ(f\circ h)\xRightarrow{\cong} (g\circ f)\circ h$$
            \item right unitality, as a natural isomorphism in Cat\footnote{Note that $\rho^{\Cat}_{Hom(X,Y)}$ is the component of the right unitor of the monoidal category $(\Cat,\times,\unit_{\Cat})$ at $Hom(X,Y)$.} $$r:\circ_{X,Y,Y}\bigcirc(id_{Hom(X,Y)}\times identity_Y)\xRightarrow{\cong}\rho^{\Cat}_{Hom(X,Y)}$$
            and as a 2-isomorphism in $\bat$
            $$r_f:f\circ id_Y\xRightarrow{\cong} f$$
            \item left unitality, as a natural isomorphism in Cat\footnote{Note that $\lambda^{\Cat}_{Hom(X,Y)}$ is the component of the left unitor of the monoidal category $(\Cat,\times,\unit_{\Cat})$ at $Hom(X,Y)$.}  $$l:\circ_{X,X,Y}\bigcirc(identity_X\times id_{Hom(X,Y)})\xRightarrow{\cong}\lambda^{\Cat}_{Hom(X,Y)}$$
            and as a 2-isomorphism in $\bat$
            $$l_f:id_X\circ f\xRightarrow{\cong} f$$

        Such natural isomorphisms can be more clearly visualized with the following diagrams\footnote{Note that these are homotopy coherent diagrams, meaning that they \textbf{do not} commute strictly necessarily, but only up to the indicated 2-morphisms!}

     These data must satisfy the following axioms: an apt version of the Mac Lane's pentagon for the associator and the triangle identity for the unitors must commute so that the associator and left/right unitors behave reasonably (see \ref{MonCat} for such diagrams for monoidal categories and see \cite{SchwHopfQuantumTFT} for the spelled out diagrams for bicategories). %could also draw the diagrams for completeness TBD /ANdrea
\end{defn}
Note that in $\unit_{\Cat}$ there is also an identity morphism of $\ast$, $id_\ast$, that gets mapped to a 2-morphism $id_{id_{X}}$ $$identity_X(id_\ast)=id_{id_{X}}:id_X\to id_X$$ The fact that $id_\ast$ is unital in $\ast$ ensures that $d_{id_{X}}$ is unital with respect to vertical composition thanks to the functoriality of $identity_X$. 

Bicategories are also known as weak 2-categories. Note that every strict 2-category is a bicategory where 1-morphisms compose strictly instead of up to associatiors and unitors; similarly to monoidal categories and strict monoidal categories
\begin{ex}
    A monoidal category $\cat$ is a one-object bicategory $\mathbf{B}\cat$ where $\cat=Hom(\mathbf{B}\cat)$. A strict monoidal category is a one-object strict 2-category.
\end{ex}
We now list some examples of 2-categories, to convey a more concrete intuition of the difference between bicategories and strict 2-categories. More generally, try to think how this difference between weak and strict categories carries on in higher dimensions.
\begin{ex}
    \begin{enumerate}\hfill
    \item Any strict 2-category is a bicategory but not viceversa.
        \item Cat and SymmMonCat are both \emph{strict} since functors compose strictly
        \item The fundamental 2-groupoid of a topological space $X$ is a \emph{strict} 2-category where objects are the points in $X$, 1-morphisms are paths and homotopy classes of homotopies between paths are 2-morphisms.
        \item Every 1-category is a strict 2-category where the only 2-morphisms are identities on 1-morphisms
        \item There is a bicategory Alg$_k^2$ where objects are algebras over a vector space, 1-morphisms are bimodules (see \ref{CatOfBimodules}) and 2-morphisms are maps between bimodules, also known as intertwiners 
        \item %TBD /ANdrea

\subsection{The Cobordism Category}\label{CobCat}
We now get to the most important example of symmetric monoidal category in this course: the symmetric monoidal category of cobordisms\footnote{See chapter 14 of \cite{FreedBordism}.}.
\begin{notat}
   Note that, if not explicitly stated we will \emph{smooth} manifold when we just write manifold.
\end{notat}
\begin{defn}[Bordism Category]\label{Bordism Cat Defn}
    The objects are closed $(n-1)$-dimensional manifolds. A morphism from $M$ to $N$ is a \textit{diffeomorphism class of} bordisms from $M$ (\textit{source}) to $N$ (\textit{target}), that is, a compact manifold with boundary $\Sigma$ together with embeddings
    $$\theta_0: [0,1) \times M \hookrightarrow \Sigma$$
    $$\theta_1: (-1,0] \times N \hookrightarrow \Sigma$$
    with a partition $p: \de \Sigma \to {0,1}$ such that
       $$\theta_0(0,M)= (\de\Sigma)_0 := p^{-1}(0)$$
       $$\theta_1(0,N)= (\de\Sigma)_1 := p^{-1}(1)$$
     Composition is given by gluing\footnote{We define bordisms with the definition with collars because it is easier to see how to glue them.} bordisms together along a common boundary for $\Sigma$ from $M$ to $N1$ and $\Sigma'$ from $N$ to $P$ we have $\Sigma' \circ \Sigma=\Sigma\cup_N\Sigma'$. 
     \begin{figure}
         \centering
         \includegraphics[width=70mm,scale=0.5]{images/Lecture 10/GlueBord.png}
         \caption{This is an illustration of gluing of two bordisms along their common boundary.}
         \label{Gluing Bordisms}
     \end{figure}
     The gluing of manifolds is associative. In order for this to actually be a category there must be unital identity morphisms. For an object $M$ it is given by $M \times [0,1]$. However, one could also take $M \times [0,2]$ which is diffeomorphic to $M \times [0,1]$ but \textit{not} strictly identical, on the nose. That is why we took a \textit{diffeomorphism class} of bordisms. In particular, the identity morphisms for any closed manifold $X\in\Bordn$, $X\xrightarrow{id_X}X$ is given by $[X\times [0,1]]_{\cong}$ where $\cong$ denotes isomorphisms between smooth manifolds, i.e. diffeomorphisms.
\end{defn}
\begin{notat}
    $nCob=\Bordn$, meaning that objects are closed $n-1$-dimensional manifolds and morphisms are diffeomorphism classes of bordisms. Moreover, we indicate that the closed manifolds are oriented and the bordisms orientation preserving with $\Bordnor$ or equivalently $nCob^{or}$.
\end{notat}
Let us explicitly state what is meant by diffeomorphism of bordisms:
\begin{defn}
    A diffeomorphism of bordisms from $M$ to $N$, $(\Sigma, p, \theta_0, \theta_1) \to (\Sigma', p', \theta_0', \theta_1')$ is a diffeomorphism $\phi: \Sigma \to \Sigma'$ of manifolds with boundary

    The commutativity of the latter diagram also implies that also extra data commute accordingly, e.g. with the partitions:

\end{defn}

\begin{ex}
    We have that 
        $$\Hom_{\nCob} (\emptyset, \emptyset) = \text{ closed $n$-manifolds}/\text{diffeomorphism}$$
    For $n=2$, $\Sigma = S^2$ is a composition of
    %DRAWING

    while a genus $g$ surface is the composite:
    %DRAWING 

    which is very reminiscent of what we did in Morse theory. There we were actually also learning how the composition of bordisms works.
\end{ex}
We just saw that $\Bordn$ is a category. It has importantly also a symmetric monoidal structure:
\begin{itemize}
    \item (M) The tensor product is given by the disjoint union of manifolds, $\otimes = \amalg$, both on objects ($M \otimes N:= M \amalg N$) and on morphisms ($\Sigma \otimes \Sigma':= \Sigma \amalg \Sigma'$). Disjoint union is functorial since for $\Sigma:M\to N$, $\Sigma':M'\to N'$, $\Lambda:N\to P$, $\Lambda':N'\to P'$ in $\Bordn$ it holds that:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $(\Sigma\cup_N\Lambda)\amalg(\Sigma'\cup_{N'}\Lambda')=(\Sigma\amalg\Sigma')\cup_{N\amalg N'}(\Lambda\amalg\Lambda')$
        \item $(M\xrightarrow{M\times[0,1]}M)\amalg(M'\xrightarrow{M'\times[0,1]}M')=M\amalg M'\xrightarrow{(M\times[0,1])\amalg (M'\times[0,1])}M\amalg M'$
        %A bit confused on how to actually check functoriality for the identity morphisms, please check if this makes sense /andrea
    \end{itemize}
    \item (O) $\unit_{\Bordn} = \emptyset$ (note that $\emptyset \amalg M \neq M$, so $\Bordn$ is not a \emph{strict} symmetric monoidal category\footnote{Note that objects were \textit{not} taken up to diffeomorphism, only morphisms.}. However, there is an isomorphism in the category since they're clearly diffeomorphic, and any diffeomorphic manifolds are cobordant. So, $\emptyset \amalg M \cong M$ in $\Bordn$, as we expect the monoidal unit to behave.
    \item (A) $M_1 \amalg (M_2 \amalg M_3) \xrightarrow{\cong} (M_1 \amalg M_2) \amalg M_3$ 
    \item (B) $\beta_{M,N}: M \amalg N \xrightarrow{\cong} N \amalg M$ and $\beta^2 = id$
\end{itemize}
\begin{rem}
    Associativity and commutativity also hold up to diffeomorphism and not strictly if one defines the disjoint union as a coproduct\footnote{A coproduct is the dual notion of (cartesian) product (see \ref{CartProd}), i.e. a coproduct in $\cat$ is a product in $\cat^{op}$.}: every coproduct is unique up to isomorphism\footnote{One can prove this in a specular way in which we proved the uniqueness of the cartesian product, see \ref{UptoIsoProds}.}, the appropriate notion of isomorphism in the category of smooth manifolds is diffeomorphism and every diffeomorphic manifold is cobordant.
\end{rem}
\subsubsection{Definition of Topological Field Theories}
Recall that a group homomorphism $\Omega_n \to \Z$ or $\R$ or \C... is a bordism invariant, which is generally quite useful and interesting. Now that we have refined our tools and have a cobordism \emph{category} instead of the cobordism \emph{group}, the bordism invariants become symmetric monoidal functors into another symmetric monoidal category since symmetric monoidal functors are the appropriate notion of homomorphism of symmetric monoidal categories.

In particular, that's how we get a topological field theory:
\begin{defn}
    A topological field theory is a symmetric monoidal functor\footnote{See \ref{SymmMonFun} for the definition of symmetric monoidal functor.} with source $\nCob$ into a symmetric monoidal category $\cat$
    $$
        \Zf: \nCob \to \cat
    $$
\end{defn}


\begin{exercise}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Compare this definition to other definitions of quantum field theory.
    \item Skim through Atiyah's original paper \cite{Atiyah1988}, how does this definition compare to his set of axioms?
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise} 
\paragraph{Outlook on the Cobordism Hypothesis and Extended Topological Field Theories}
\begin{rem}\label{RemarkOnCobHypo}
    After skimming through \cite{Atiyah1988} one might wonder why we defined the target category of a topological field to be just a general symmetric monoidal category and not specifically $(\Vect, \otimes)$, as Atiyah did, or at least something similar, in the end we are studying topological \emph{quantum field theories}! There are probably %added 'probably' because I'm unsure if it's true, is it true?/andrea
    several reasons why someone would want to do so, for example for representation theoretic ones\footnote{e.g. \cite{stroppel2022categorification}, later we will also show that one must pick categories different to $\Vect_k$ in order to get interesting 3dTFTs and connect them with the Jones polynomial from knot theory, see \ref{sec:3d_tfts}}. One of the crucial ones in particular is that one of the guiding conjectures of this field, the cobordism hypothesis, is formulated without mentioning specifically $\Vect_k$ as a target category. The cobordism hypothesis informally states that any TFT, at any dimension, can be classified/constructed just by observing where the TFT in question maps the positively oriented point\footnote{We will soon see a proof of the 1-dimensional case \ref{ClassificationOf1dTFTs}.}. It was formulated by James Dolan and John Baez in \cite{Baez_1995} and now we have only partial proofs, \cite{lurie2009classification}, \cite{schommerpries2014classification}, \cite{ayala2017cobordism} and \cite{grady2022geometric}. The moral of the story is that "The history of the Baez-Dolan conjecture \textit{[i.e. the cobordism hypothesis]} goes most directly through quantum field theory and its adaptation to low-dimensional topology. Yet in retrospect it is a theorem about the structure of manifolds in all dimensions..." \cite{freed2012cobordism} and hence TFTs are of interest with respect to any suitable target category, not only the ones of interest from the viewpoint of physics.
    \end{rem}
\begin{rem}[Remark on Extended TFTs]\label{RemarkExtendedTFTs}
         After defining the cobordism hypothesis in this manner, a natural question is: how can TFTs of any dimension greater than 1 be classified by evaluating them at a point? If we stick to our definition, there are no points in any category of bordisms of dimension greater than 1. Fortunately, one can \emph{extend} the bordism category, and consequently TFTs, and also talk about lower dimensions. Take as an example $\Bord^{or}_{2,1}$. As we defined the bordism category, in this case the lowest dimension is 1, the objects are lines, not points. Nevertheless, one could treat the category of 2 dimensional bordisms as a 2-category, more specifically as a bicategory (see \ref{Bicategory})\footnote{Since 1-morphisms do not compose strictly, but up to an appropriate notion of isomorphism.}, $\Bord_{2,1,0}$ where objects are disjoint unions of points, 1-morphisms are oriented cobordisms between points and 2-morphisms are cobordisms between the 1-morphisms; and then define 2d-TFTs as an appropriate notion of symmetric monoidal functor between symmetric monoidal bicategories\footnote{A detailed treatment of the 2d case is found in \cite{schommerpries2014classification}.}. Treating a TFT as a functor\footnote{To be rigorous, one would need to precisify what is an appropriate notion of functor between bicategories.} from a symmetric monoidal\footnote{Although we did not define a symmetric monoidal bicategory, there is indeed a way to do this, see the appendix C of \cite{schommerpries2014classification} for a definition and chapter 2 for an exposition.} bicategory (instead of from a symmetric monoidal category) is sometimes named 'once-extended TFT', e.g. \cite{SchwHopfQuantumTFT}. One can extended downward to dimension $0$ any $n$-dimensional TFT and it was first proposed by Daniel Freed in \cite{Freed_1994}. To be precise, one nowadays does not want to restrict themselves just to $n-$categories but wants to work with$(\infty,n)$-categories, i.e. categories where morphisms of dimension strictly greater than $n$ are invertible, because of technical reasons\footnote{For example, the argument sketched in \cite{lurie2009classification} is crucially a proof by induction on $n$ and in order to understand the $n+1$-morphisms of $\Bord_{n+1}$ one must understand such $n+1$-morphisms in $\Bord_{n}$ which are absent if we treat $\Bord_{n}$ as an $n$-category and not $(\infty,n)$-category. In short, that would just not be possible without such $\infty$-categorical machinery.}. Sketchily, the $(\infty,n)$ category of bordisms will have points as objects, bordisms between points as 1-morphisms, bordisms between bordisms between points as 2-morphisms,..., bordisms between bordisms between bordisms...\footnote{There is exactly $n-1$ times 'between bordisms' after the first instance of 'bordisms', $n$-morphisms are morphisms between $(n-1)$-morphisms.} as $n$-morphisms, diffeomorphisms between $n$-dimensional bordisms as $n+1$-morphisms, isotopies between diffeomorphisms as $n+2$-morphisms, isotopies between isotopies between diffeomorphsims as $n+3$-morphisms, ... and so on infinitely many times. This is an example of a $(\infty,n)$-category, since isotopies of diffeomorphisms and diffeomorphisms are in fact invertible, whereas oriented bordisms not necessarily. One can find more on this higher category of bordisms in \cite{Calaque_2019}. 
\end{rem}
\paragraph{Back to Usual TFTs}
\begin{rem}
    A TFT is a functor in a similar way that a linear representation of a group\footnote{In fact, some regard it a kind of representation, check out for instance around minute 18:00 of \hyperlink{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9FxudwLWzg}{Catharina Stroppel: The beauty of braids - from knot invariants to higher categories}; or the following quote from \hyperlink{https://www.hsm.uni-bonn.de/fileadmin/hsm/pictures/TQFT_Poster_01.pdf}{a poster for a conference on TQFTs and their connections to representation theory and mathematical physics} "...a TQFT is a symmetric monoidal functor from the cobordism category to some symmetric monoidal category. It can thus be seen as a representation of a fundamental geometric category on a target category and thereby organizes interesting algebraic structures, e.g. representations of mapping class groups, in terms of cobordism categories. ..."; or this quote from Daniel Freed "An extended topological field theory is a representation of the bordism category..." \cite{freed2012cobordism}.} is (see \ref{Representations of Groups}). We can construct the category of TFTs in an analagous way to the one we used to define the category of linear representations of a group (see \ref{Cat of representations}): by constructing a functor category where the objects are TFTs (hence particular symmetric monoidal functors) and morphisms apt natural transformations between them\footnote{See \ref{SymmMonNat} for the definition of a symmetric monoidal natural transformation.}. The category of $n$-dimensional TFTs will then be $Hom_{SymmMonCat}(\nCob,\cat)$ (see \ref{CatSymmMonCat} for the definition of $SymmMonCat$, the category of all symmetric monoidal categories). Similarly as with groups, one can have linear and non-linear representations, although linear representations appear more frequenly. Typical examples of linear target categories are $(AbGrp,\otimes),(Mod_R,\otimes),(\Vect_k,\otimes)$.
\end{rem}

\begin{notat}[Category of TFTs]
    The category of TFTs is the functor category $$Hom_{SymmMonCat}(\nCob,\cat)=Fun^\otimes(\nCob,\cat)=\TFT_n(\cat)=nTFT(\cat)$$ This functor category is symmetric monoidal by defining the tensor product between TFTs pointwise: for $\Zf_1,\Zf_2\in\TFT_{n,n-1}(\cat)=n\TFT(\cat)$ and $M\in\nCob$ $$(\Zf_1\otimes\Zf_2)(M):=\Zf_1(M)\otimes\Zf_2(M)$$
\end{notat}
TFTs were originally defined with Vect as the target category, $\Zf: (\nCob, \amalg) \to (\Vect, \otimes) $), see \cite{Atiyah1988}. We can infer a few things about this TFT:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\Sigma$ closed $n$ manifold, we can then view it as a bordism $\emptyset \xrightarrow{\Sigma} \emptyset$ and then we can apply $Z$ and we get $Z(\emptyset) \xrightarrow{Z(\Sigma)} Z(\emptyset)$ but $Z(\emptyset) = k$, since that's the unit in $\Vect$. So $\Zf(\Sigma)$ is a linear map from $k$ to $k$, which is entirely determined by where it sends one element. We then get that $\Zf(\Sigma)(\unit)$ is a diffeomorphism invariant.

    In fact, the original hope was to use TFTs to find new diffeomorphism invariants.
    \item There is a "trivial" TFT which on objects acts as $\Zf(M) = k$ and on morphisms as $\Zf(\Sigma) = id_k$ and we write $Z = 1$.
    \item An \emph{invertible} TFT is a TFT in which $Z(M) \cong k$ and $Z(\Sigma)$ is an isomorphism. Which is very similar but in the trivial TFT we have chosen not only $Z(M) \cong k$ but specifically $Z(M) = k$.
    This is related to "anomalies" in physics\footnote{To precisely see how, one needs to work with \emph{extended} TFTs, a higher categorical refinement of what we are working with now. See \cite{muller2020extended}.}.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{ex}
    Euler characteristic ($\to$ Euler theory)

    Fix $\lambda \in \C^*$
    \begin{equation}
        Z_\lambda (\Sigma) := \lambda^{\chi(\Sigma)}, \quad Z(M) = \C
    \end{equation}
    Here functoriality follows from additivity
    \begin{equation}
        \chi(X \cup Y) = \chi(X) + \chi(Y) - \chi(X \cap Y)
    \end{equation}
\end{ex}


\begin{defn}
    Let $(\cat, \otimes, \unit_\cat)$ be a monoidal category. An object $X \in \cat$ is invertible if there is a $Y \in \cat$ such that $X \otimes Y \cong \unit_\cat$.  
\end{defn}

\begin{ex}
    In $(\Vect_k, \otimes)$, $X$ is invertible iff there is a vector space $Y$ such that $X\otimes Y \cong k$.
\end{ex}

\begin{notat}
    $\cat^\times \subset \cat$ subset of invertible objects and isomorphisms. We will later see that this is the underlying Picard groupoid (see \ref{PicardDualizable}) and synonymous with $(\cat^{dualizable})^\simeq$ because of \ref{InvertibleDualizable}.
\end{notat}
%dim(X \otimes Y) =  dim(X)dim (Y) = dim X = 1....?
\begin{notat}
    For some symmetric monoidal category $(\cat,\otimes,\unit_\cat)$ we sometimes explicitly denote its tensor product by $\cat^\otimes$. For example, $\Set^\times$, $\Set^\amalg$, $\Vect^\oplus$, $\Vect^\otimes$.
\end{notat}

We can now rigorously define what we previously called an invertible TFT: 
\begin{defn}
    An invertible TFT is an invertible object in $Fun^\otimes(\Bordn,\cat)$. This is equivalent to the fact that $\Zf$ factors through $\cat^\times$:

\paragraph{Outlook on Invertible Field Theories}\label{Spectra Phases of Matter}
These theories can be studied with stable homotopy theory. However, in order to allow the application of such machinery, one must fully extend topological field theories (see \ref{RemarkExtendedTFTs}), i.e. with $(\infty,n)$-categories of bordisms as a source. So, in the case of extended TFTs, $|\Bord|$ and $\cat^\times$ both are $\infty$-groupoids since we get $|\Bord|$ by adjoining all inverses for all morphisms and $\cat^\times$ is obtained by forgetting about non-invertible morphisms (and objects) of $\cat$.

We previously talked about the fundamental $\infty$-groupoid of a space while sketching the homotopy hypothesis (see \ref{HomotopyHypothesis}) and told a story about how spaces are equivalent to $\infty$-groupoids. Hence, $\tilde\Zf$ corresponds to a map of spaces via this equivalence.

However, we do not have just $\infty$-groupoids but also a symmetric monoidal structure on both $|\Bord|$ and $\cat^\times$. Recall that intuitively the delooping of a group in a one-object groupoid and the delooping of a certain monoidal $k$-category is an one-object $k+1$-category. Having symmetric monoidal $\infty$-groupoids allow us to deloop infinitely many times. From this it follows that the spaces corresponding to $|\Bord|$ and $\cat^{\times}$ are infinite loop spaces. An infinite loop space is a space $S_0$ with an infinite sequence of pointed spaces $S_0,S_1,S_2,...$ where $S_n$ is the delooping\footnote{We talked of deloopings just for categories but there is a corresponding notion for spaces. If you do not believe this, apply the equivalence of the homotopy hypothesis.} of $S_{n-1}$ and conversely $S_{n-1}$ is the loop space\footnote{The loop space object is an inverse operation to the delooping, meaning that that given some monoidal category $\cat$, $\cat$ is the loop space object of the delooping of $\cat$. The name comes from the topological notion, see \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_space}. In general, loop space objects inherit the monoidal structure from the composition of loops. We would need to talk about homotopy pullbacks in order to strictly define what a loop space object is.} object of $S_n$. Infinite loop spaces correspond to \href{https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/connective+spectrum}{connective spectra}. Spectra are a higher categorical analog of abelian groups (see \ref{Ab-Enriched Cat}), they have been in fact called “the abelian groups of the 21st century” \cite{Mazel-Gee2024}. They are the main characters of stable homotopy theory, check out \cite{GregoricSpectra} for a great informal introduction (although assuming working knowledge of $\infty$-category theory). While the degree homotopy groups for usual topological spaces are defined to be positive, homotopy groups of spectra can be defined and be non-trivial also for negative degrees. Connective spectra are spectra that only have positive non-trivial homotopy groups. They are called connective because a synonym is ($-1$)-connected spectra, referring to the convention that an $n$-connected space is a space where its homotopy groups for all $k\leq n$ are trivial. This is why $\tilde\Zf$ is not just a map of spaces but a map of spectra, and this enables the application of stable homotopy theory, making life easier. We can conclude this interlude on stable homotopy theory and invertible TFTs with the following motto

$$\text{\textit{Invertible TFTs are (equivalently) maps of spectra!}}$$

This is not only of theoretical interest but it also allows the application of topological field theories to condensed matter theory! Classical phases of matter are governed by Landau theory of phase transition. However, the phases of a quantum material do not behave in the same manner. Fortunately, there are ways to describe them, or at least specific types of quantum matter (with gapped Hamiltonians for instance)\footnote{Kitaev for instance proposed in \cite{Kitaev_2009} that the topological insulators and superconductors of a certain type of condensed matter are classifiable via K-theory\footnote{See \url{https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/topological+phase+of+matter} and \url{https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/K-theory+classification+of+topological+phases+of+matter}.} and this was further refined via twisted equivariant K-theory by Dan Freed and Greg Moore in \cite{Freed_2013}. }. The topological field theories describing the (\href{https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/topological+phase+of+matter}{topological}) phases of matter of some condensed matter systems (with short range entanglement) are \emph{invertible} field theories. The connection to stable homotopy theory allows to compute topological invariants of spectra and thereby of phases of matter. This was done by Freed and Hopkins in \cite{Freed_2021} and in \cite{freed2014shortrange}.

Given $\Zf:\Bordn\to\Vect_k$ and $M\in\Bordn$, one can prove that $\Zf(M)$ is a finite dimensional vector space. Specifically, we have that $\dim \Zf (M) = \Zf (M \times S^1)(1)$, where $M \times S^1$ is an $n$ dimensional cobordism from $\emptyset$ to $\emptyset$.
\begin{proof}
    Decompose $M\times S^1$ into two semicircles $M\times [0,1]$. Then it gets mapped by $\Zf$ to $\Vect_k$ in the following manner

    The fact that these two diagrams commute is called snake relations. If the diagrams commute, then $X$ is the right dual of $Y$ and $Y$ is the left dual of $X$.

    Equivalently, a (left/right) dual object $X$ in a monoidal category $\cat$ can also be characterized as a (left/right) adjoint (see \ref{AdjFun}) when considered as a morphism in the delooping (see \ref{DeloopingMonCat}) bicategory (see \ref{Bicategory}) $\mathbf{B}\cat$ of $\cat$. This makes sense because:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the evaluation map $ev_X$ corresponds to the counit $\epsilon$ of the adjunction 
        \item the coevaluation map $coev_X$ to the unit $\eta$ of the adjunction
        \item the two diagrams (\ref{DUAL1} and \ref{DUAL2}) to the triangle identities of the adjunction
    \end{itemize} 
\end{defn}
\begin{rem}
    If $\cat$ is braided, and in particular for us symmetric, any right dual is a left dual and viceversa.
\end{rem}
\begin{notat}
    Usually, the dual of an object $X$ is denoted with $X^\vee$.

\begin{cor}\label{ImageOfDualStillDual}
     Let $F:\cat\to\dat$ be a monoidal functor. Thanks to monoidal functoriality, the monoidal unit $\unit_\cat$ is sent to $\unit_\dat$ (up to isomorphism), and hence one gets the evaluation map and coevaluation map: $ev_{F(X)}:F(Y)\otimes F(X)\to\unit_\dat\cong F(\unit_\cat)$ and $coev_{F(X)}:F(\unit_\cat)\cong\unit_\dat\to F(X)\otimes F(Y)$. Moreover, the image of a commuting diagram under a functor still commutes (see \ref{FunctorsPreserveCommut}). So, the dual objects are sent to dual objects by monoidal functors and $F(X^\vee)=F(X)^\vee$.
\end{cor}

\begin{ex}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Any finite dimensional vector space $V$ has a dual, namely $V^\vee$:
    \begin{align}
        ev_V&: V^\vee \otimes V \to k\\
        coev_V &: k \to V \otimes V^\vee
    \end{align}
    %TODO write what is sent to what.
\item As an exercise try $Set, \times$
\item $\cat = \Bordnor$.
The point $\bullet_+$ is dualizable with dual $\bullet_-$.

    Given symmetric monoidal categories $\cat$ and $\dat$, symmetric monoidal functors $F,G:\cat\to\dat$ and a symmetric monoidal natural transfromation $\alpha:F\Rightarrow G$, if $X\in\cat$ is dualizable, then $\alpha_X:F(X)\to G(X)$ is invertible.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
    We claim that the inverse is given by $\alpha_{(X^\vee)^\vee}$. Following \ref{DualMorph}, $\alpha_{(X^\vee)^\vee}:G(X^\vee)^\vee\to F(X^\vee)^\vee$. Note that $F(X^\vee)=F(X)^\vee$ and thus $F(X^\vee)^\vee=F(X)^{\vee\vee}=F(X)$ and so $\alpha_{(X^\vee)^\vee}:G(X)\to F(X)$. Remember that $ev_X:X^\vee\otimes X\to \unit_\cat$ and $coev_X:\unit_\cat\to X\otimes X^\vee$. We prove that the following diagram commutes

First of all, the triangle on the top commutes, i.e. $(id_{G(X)}\otimes\alpha_{X^\vee}\otimes\alpha_X)\circ(id_{G(X)}\otimes F(coev_X))=id_{G(X)}\otimes G(coev_X)$, because of the naturality of $\alpha$. The triangle underneath it also commutes, i.e. $id_{G(X)}\otimes\alpha_{X^{\vee}}\otimes\alpha_{X}=(id_{G(X)}\otimes id_{G(X)}\otimes\alpha_{X})\circ (id_{G(X)}\otimes\alpha_{X^{\vee}}\otimes id_{id_{F(X)}})$  because of the unitality of $id_{G(X)}$ and $id_{F(X)}$. Lastly, the bottom trapezoid commutes thanks to the naturality of $\alpha$ and thus the whole big diagram commutes. Consider now first mapping leftwards and successively downwards, i.e. $(G(ev_X)\otimes id_{G(X)})\circ id_{G(X)}\otimes G(coev_X)$, this equals to the identity by one of the two snake relations of dual objects. Take now the other route of the outer diagram, on the right; note that $(\alpha_X\vee)\vee=(G(ev_{X})\otimes id_{F(X)})\circ (id_{G(X)}\otimes\alpha_{X^\vee}\otimes id_{F(X)})\circ id_{G(X)}\otimes F(coev_{X})$ by definition (\ref{DualMorph}) and hence the right route on the outer diagram corresponds to $\alpha_X\circ(\alpha_{X^\vee})^\vee$. Since the outer diagram commutes we obtain that $\alpha_X\circ(\alpha_{X^\vee})^\vee=id_{G(X)}$, i.e. $(\alpha_{X^\vee})^\vee$ is the right inverse of $\alpha_X$. One constructs a symmetric diagram by substituting $F$s with $G$s to prove that it is also the left inverse.
\end{proof}
\begin{cor}
    If every object in a symmetric monoidal category $\cat$ is dualizable, then any symmetric monoidal natural transformation between symmetric monoidal functors that have $\cat$ as the source category is invertible since a natural transfomation is invertible if and only if each of its components is invertible. Hence, $Fun^\otimes(\cat,\dat)$ is a groupoid for any $\dat$ when all objects in $\cat$ are dualizable.
\end{cor}
\begin{cor}\label{TFTsareGRPDS}
    The category of topological field theories $TFT_{n,n-1}^{or}(\cat)$ is a groupoid.
\end{cor}
\begin{lem}\label{InvDual}
    Any invertible object is dualizable
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
    Let $X$ be an invertible object. Then, there must be an $X^{-1}$ such that $X\otimes X^{-1}\cong\mathbb{1}_\cat$, the invertible object is the dual of $X$. The co/evaluation maps become isomorphisms and hence the snake relations hold\footnote{Note that every diagram composed solely of isomorphisms commutes.}.
\end{proof}
\begin{lem}\label{InvertibleDualizable}
    A dualizable object is invertible if and only if its co/evaluation maps are isomorphisms.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
    $\implies$ directly follows from \ref{InvDual} since any invertible object has as co/evaluation maps isomorphisms. Conversely, suppose that $X$ is a dualizable object and the co/evaluation maps are isomorphisms. Then, there is a $Y\in\cat$ such that $ev_X:Y\otimes X\cong \mathbb{1}$.
\end{proof}
\begin{cor}
    If $\cat$ is a monoidal groupoid, then dualizable objects are invertible.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
    Since $\cat$ is a groupoid, then also the co/evaluation maps are isomorphisms. From \ref{InvertibleDualizable} it follows that the dualizable objects are invertible.
\end{proof}
\begin{cor}\label{PicardDualizable}
    A Picard groupoid (\ref{PicardGroupoid}) is equivalently a monoidal groupoid where every object is dualizable.
\end{cor}

    The underlying groupoid of $\Bordnor$ is a picard groupoid

\subsubsection{Classification of 1d-TFTs}\label{ClassificationOf1dTFTs}
The main goal of this subsection is to prove that given an oriented 1d-TFT $Z:\Bord_{1,0}\to\cat$, $Z(\bullet)$ has a dual and conversely, given an object $X\in\cat$, in the codomain of the TFT, and its dual $(Y,ev_X,coev_X)$, we can reconstruct a 1d-TFT.
\begin{lem}\label{Surjectivity}
    Let $X\in\cat$ be a dualizable object with $Y$ as dual. Then the following determines a 1d-TFT: $$Z(\bullet_+):=X$$ $$Z(\bullet_-):=Y$$ $$Z():=ev_X$$ $$Z():=coev_X$$
\end{lem}

\end{proof}

\begin{rem}
    By $(\cat^{\text{dualizable}})^{\cong}$ we denote the restriction of a symmetric monoidal category on its dualizable objects and its isomorphisms, said briefly: a restriction on the underlying Picard groupoid because in any symmetric monoidal groupoid an object is dualizable if and only if it is invertible (see \ref{PicardDualizable}).
\end{rem}
\begin{thm}
    Let $\cat$ be a symmetric monoidal category. Then the map\footnote{There is unfortunately a notational clash between what we called the evaluation map for dualizable objects, denoted by $ev$, and what we also call in this case evaluation map, denoted by $\mathcal{E} V$. In the latter case, we are referring to a similar convention we use for example in topology when we call a map of this genre $Map(\ast,X)\to X$ an evaluation map. The intuition is that we feed an element of the domain into a map, a functor in our case, and see what happens, "evaluate it".} $$TFT_{1,0}^{or}=Fun(\Bord_{1,0}^{or}(\cat)\xrightarrow{\mathcal{E} V}(\cat^{\text{dualizable}})^{\cong}$$ 
    $$\Zf\mapsto \Zf(\bullet_+)$$ is a symmetric monoidal equivalence of groupoids.

\end{thm}
The image of $\mathcal{E}V$ is in $(\cat^{dualizable})^{\cong}$, since \begin{enumerate}
    \item $TFT_{1,0}^{or}$ is a groupoid, and functors preserve isomorphisms
    \item Every object in $\Bord_{1,0}^{or}$ is dualizable, because of functoriality, the image of a dualizable object remains a dualizable object
\end{enumerate}
\begin{proof}
    Thanks to the fundamental theorem of category theory we prove three things to demonstrate that $\mathcal{E}V$ is an equivalence: that is full, faithful and essentially surjective.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item From lemma \ref{Surjectivity} it follows that $\mathcal{E}V$ is surjective, not even surjective
        \item It is full: let $\Zf,\Zf'\in TFT_{1,0}^{or}$ and $\alpha_1,\alpha_2:\Zf\Rightarrow\Zf'$ be natural transformations between them and hence isomorphisms (see \ref{TFTsareGRPDS}). $\bullet_-=\bullet_+^\vee$ we have that for any natural isomorphism $\eta$: $\eta{\bullet_+^\vee}=(\eta{\bullet_+})^\vee$ because of functoriality and $\eta_{\bullet_-}=(\eta{\bullet_+}^\vee)^{-1}$ because of \ref{DualizableMeansInvertibleNatTrans}. From this it follows that $\alpha_{\bullet_-}=(\alpha_{\bullet_+}^\vee)^{-1}=(\beta{\bullet_+}^\vee)^{-1}=\beta_{\bullet_-}$. With a specular proof we can prove that $\alpha_{\bullet_+}=\beta_{\bullet_+}$. Since 0-dimensional compact manifolds are just finite disjoint unions of $\bullet_+$ or $\bullet_-$ and $\Zf,\Zf'$ are both symmetric \emph{monoidal} functors, it follows that for any $X\in\Bord_{1,0}^{or}$, $\alpha_X=\beta_X$. Take for example $X=\bullet_+\amalg\bullet_-$, then  $\Zf(\bullet_+\amalg\bullet_-)=\Zf(\bullet_+)\otimes\Zf(\bullet_-)$. Thus $\alpha=\beta$. This proves that $\mathcal{E}V$ is faithful because it implies that for any two equal natural transformations are mapped to equal morphisms in $\cat$
        %Copied this from Freed Old/new and I am very confused, please check /Andrea
        \item $\mathcal{E}V$ is full %TBD
    \end{enumerate}
    
\end{proof}
This is the simplest case of an important guiding hypothesis in the field of TFTs, the cobordism hypothesis, see \ref{RemarkOnCobHypo}.

Recap: $\TFT_{1,0}^{or},\cat) \xrightarrow{\mathscr Ev_{\bullet+}} (\cat^{dualiz})^{\simeq} \hookrightarrow \cat$. The map is the following: $\Zf \mapsto \Zf(\bullet_+)$.

Now we classified 1 dimensional TFTs, we would now like to do the same for 2 dimensional TFTs and we will find that there is an equivalence between $\TFT_{2,1}^{or}(\cat)$ and commutative Frobenius algebras.

\subsubsection{Classification of 2d-TFTs}
As we have done for the 1-dimensional case, we now try to classify 2-dimensional TFTs. For a more detailed proof see Kock \cite{kock_2003} or the lecture notes from Schweigert \cite{SchwHopfQuantumTFT}. 

We have already defined the following notions in arbitrary monoidal categories (see \ref{FrobAlg}, \ref{MonObj}, \ref{ComonObj}, \ref{CommFrobAlg}, \ref{CommBim}). However, we now explicitly state how the abstract formal definitions are instantiated in Vect$_k$.
\begin{defn}[Algebra over a Field]
    An algebra\footnote{Note that for us algebras are \textbf{always} associative and unital.} over a field $k$ is a monoid object (\ref{MonObj}) in $\Vect_k$. More generally a left/right $R-$algebra is a monoid object in the category of left/right $R-$modules. The latter generalization holds also for the next definitions of $k-$coalgebra, $k-$bialgebra and Frobenius $k-$algebra.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}[Coalgebra over a Field]
    A $k-$coalgebra is a comonoid object in $\Vect_k$.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}[Bialgebra over a Field]
    A $k-$bialgebra is a bimonoid object (see \ref{BimonObj} in $\Vect_k$. More explicitly, it is simultaneously an $k-$algebra and a $k-$coalgebra, a monoid and a comonoid object in $\Vect_k$. A $k-$bialgebra is commutative in $\Vect_k$, if the underlying monoid is commutative, or viceversa, if the underlying comonoid is commutative. 
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Frobenius $k-$Algebra]\label{Frobk-Alg}
    A Frobenius $k-$algebra a Frobenius algebra (see \ref{FrobAlg}) in a $\Vect_k$. It is commutative if it is also a commutative $k-$bialgebra.
\end{defn}

These definitions are perfectly fine, if we disregard pedagogical considerations. However, they might still seem mysterious to someone not used to this abstract nonsense. For this reason, we now give three more concrete definitions of a Frobenius algebra. They are all equivalent.

\begin{rmnd}
    A pairing $K: W \otimes V \to k$ is non-degenerate if it is part of a data exhibiting $W$ as the dual of $V$, i.e. $\exists \gamma: k \to V \otimes W$ such that ...
\end{rmnd}

If $V,W$ finite dimensional, this is equivalent to saying that 
\begin{align}
    &K^\# : V \to W^\vee := \Hom_k(W,k), \quad v \mapsto K(- \otimes v) \\
    &K_\# : W \to V^\vee := \Hom_k(V,k), \quad w \mapsto K(w \otimes -) 
\end{align}
are isomorphisms.

    What's the analogous reformulation of "$X \in \cat$ is dualizable?"

\begin{defn}
    A $k$-algebra is a monoid object in $\Vect_k$. More explicitly, it is a $k$-vector space $A$ together with linear maps:

        &\eta: k \to A
    \end{align}

    A homomorphism $\phi: A \to B$ of $k$ algebras is a linear map that preserves/commutes with $(\mu_A, \eta_A)$ and $(\mu_B, \eta_B)$, a monoid homomorphism. 
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
    A \textit{co}algebra is a comonoid object in $\Vect_k$. More explicitly, one simply takes 
   $$ \Delta: A \to A \otimes A $$
   $$ \epsilon: A \to k $$
and reversing the arrows in the diagrams.
\end{defn}
 A homomorphisms of $k$-coalgebras accordingly preserve $(\Delta_A, \epsilon_A)$ and $(\Delta_B, \epsilon_B)$. It is a monoid homomorphism in $\Vect_k^{op}$

\begin{ex}
    Take the vector space $A = k[x]/x^2 = k \oplus kx$ and take the map $A \to A \otimes A$ which sends $x \mapsto 1 \otimes x + x \otimes 1$ and $1 \mapsto 1 \otimes 1$ and the map $\epsilon: A \to k$ which sends 1 to 1 and $x$ to 0.
\end{ex}


\begin{defn}[First definition]
    A ($k$-) Frobenius algebra is a (finite dimensional) $k$ algebra $(A,\mu,\nu)$ together with an associative (=invariant) non-degenerate pairing $k: A \otimes A \to k$, i.e.
    \begin{equation}
        K(ab,c) = K(a, bc)
    \end{equation}
\end{defn}
The fact that the pairing is invariant actually tells us something about the algebra structure, not only the vector space structure.

\begin{ex}
    $A = \Mat_{n\times n} (k)$ with matrix multiplication, in which the pairing $K$ is simply the composition of multiplication and taking the trace, i.e. $K = \tr \circ \mu$.
    \begin{proof}
        Need to show nondegeneracy. Pick a basis of $\Mat_{n\times n} (k)$ given by $\{E_{ij}\}$ with 1 in the $j$th row and $i$th column. We then have the dual basis $\{E_{ji}\}$ and we have an isomorphism of $A$ and $A^\vee$ given by $E_{ij} \mapsto E_{ji}$. Then we can compute: $K$ is exactly the evaluation.
    \end{proof}
\end{ex}

Note that in the proof we used an isomorphism of $A$ and $A^\vee$ to get the nondegenerate invariant pairing. This leads to the following alternative definition:

\begin{defn}[Second definition]
    A ($\Phi-$) Frobenius algebra is a (finite dimensional) algebra $A$ with a left $A-$module isomorphism $\Phi: A \to A^\vee$.
\end{defn}
The left $A-$module part again gives us the compatibility with the algebra structure. 
\begin{rem}
    For the definition to make sense $A$ and $A^\vee$ should be left $A-$modules: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $M=A$ is an $A$ module via $A \otimes M \to M$ which sends $(a,m) \mapsto \mu(a,m)$.
        \item $M=A^\vee$ is an $A$ module via $A \otimes M \to M = A^\vee = \Hom(A,k)$ which sends $(a,\phi) \mapsto \phi(\mu(a,-))$.
    \end{itemize}
    Then a left $A-$module map should satisfy $\Phi(a \cdot m) = a \cdot \Phi(m)$.
\end{rem}
\begin{ex}
    Let's check that the map $\Phi$ in the previous example was actually a left $A-$module isomorphism. We would like
    \begin{equation}
        \Phi(A \cdot E_{ij}) = A \cdot \Phi(E_{ij})
    \end{equation}
    which is true when explicitly calculating both sides.
\end{ex}

\begin{defn}[Third definition]
    A $(\Delta, \epsilon)-$ Frobenius algebra is a finite dimensional algebra $(A,\mu,\nu)$ together with a coalgebra structure $(A,\Delta, \epsilon)$ such that the \textit{Frobenius relation} $$(\mathbb{1}_\cat\otimes\mu)\circ(\Delta\otimes\mathbb{1}_\cat)=\Delta\circ\mu=(\mu\otimes\unit_\cat)\circ(\unit_\cat\otimes\Delta)$$ holds. This means that the following diagram commutes

\end{defn}

Note that the the only way in which we exploited the fact that we are working with vector spaces is that we had the tensor product and the unit with respect to this product. In other words, we only used the fact that $\Vect$ is a symmetric monoidal category, so the definitions work in any symmetric monoidal category\footnote{Take a detour in the subsection on monoidal categories (\ref{MonCat}), and more specifically take a look at \ref{FrobAlg}, if you want to see a definition for general monoidal categories.}. This is important to keep in mind because the target category of our 2d-TFTs might not be $\Vect_k$.

\begin{prop}
    The three definitions of Frobenius algebra are equivalent.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
    (1) $\iff$ (2) is an exercise.

    (3) $\implies$ (1): we set $K = \epsilon \circ \mu: A \otimes A \to k$ and $\gamma = \Delta \circ \eta$, however these are not duality data that show that $K$ is a nondegenerate pairing. 

    \noindent We can then define $\Phi: = (id_{A^\vee} \otimes K) \circ (coev_A \otimes id_A)$ which is an isomorphism with inverse $id_A \otimes ev_A) \circ (\gamma \otimes id_{A^\vee})$. Then using in addition this isomorphism one can prove that $K$ is a nondegenerate pairing.

    (1) $\implies$ (3) we can define $\Delta := \mu \circ (\gamma \otimes id_A)$ and $\epsilon := K \circ(id \otimes \mu)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{rmnd}
    $\TFT_{2,1}^{or}(\cat)$ is a groupoid (see \ref{TFTsareGRPDS}).
\end{rmnd}

\begin{thm}[Classification of 2 dimensional TFTs]
    The functor 
    $$\TFT_{2,1}^{or} (\cat) \to \cFrob_{\cat}$$
    $$\Zf \mapsto \Zf(S^1)$$
    is an equivalence of groupoids\footnote{We soon prove that also the category of Frobenius algebras is a groupoid.}.
\end{thm}
The category $\cFrob_\cat$ has as objects commutative Frobenius algebras on an arbitrary symmetric monoidal category $\cat$, i.e. Frobenius algebras that are also commutative bimonoid objects (\ref{CommBim}), as morphisms it has Frobenius homomorphisms, i.e. morphisms of monoids that are also morphisms of comonoids and preserve all the structure of a Frobenius algebra. One could have also proven a statement with $\Vect_k$ as the target category and proven that $\TFT_{2,1}^{or} (\Vect_k) \simeq \cFrob_{k}$. Note that the category of commutative Frobenius algebras in an arbitrary symmetric monoidal category is indeed a groupoid: 
\begin{thm}
    The category of Frobenius algebras on an arbitrary symmetric monoidal category $\cat$ is a groupoid.
\end{thm}
%have to think about a proof for arbitrary symm mon cats, Kock just proves it for Vectk
\begin{proof}
    Let $(A,\epsilon,\eta,\Delta,\mu),(A',\epsilon',\eta',\Delta',\mu')\in\cFrob_\cat$ and $\phi:A\to A'$ be a Frobenius homomorphism. Then  
\end{proof}
Take a look at \cite{kock_2003} for a proof for Frobenius $k$-algebras, i.e. Frobenius algebras in $\Vect_k$

\begin{proof}
    (1) We need to prove that $\Zf(S^1) =:A$ is a commutative Frobenius algebra. We get the product from the pair of pants and the coproduct from the copants. The unit and counit maps are simply given by the cup and cocup. Showing that this is actually a Frobenius algebra now just amounts to drawing the commutative diagram for a Frobenius algebra in the category of bordisms, i.e. all maps are simply bordisms.

    (2) We now want see that it's a functor. Let $\Zf, \Zf'$ be two TFTs and $\alpha: \Zf \implies \Zf'$ be a natural transformation.
    \begin{clm}
        $f = \alpha(S): A=\Zf(S^1) \to \Zf'(S^1)=B$ is a homomorphism of commutative Frobenius algebras.
    \end{clm}
    We just use naturality of $\alpha$ several times. %TODO diagram
\end{proof}

For functoriality we did not check that compositions of morphisms (natural transformations) are sent to compositions (of morphisms in $\cFrob$).

Now, we want to prove the converse direction: given a commutative Frobenius algebra $A$, construct an oriented 2d-TFT such that $\Zf(S^1)= A$. We want to define a TFT $\Zf$. On objects we simply set $\Zf(S^1, or_+) \mapsto A$ %TODO how to write orientation of S^1
and $\Zf(S^1, or_-) \mapsto A^\vee$. This is enough because objects in $\Bord_{2,1}^{or}$ are closed 1 dimensional manifolds and therefore diffeomorphic to a disjoint union of $S^1$s. Therefore, if $Y$ is a connected one dimensional manifold we have an orientation preserving diffeomorphism $Y \to S^1$, but in which sense is this unique? 
\begin{defn}[Diffeomorphism Group]\label{DiffeoGroup}

Note that the diffeomorphism group can be considered a topological group (see \ref{TopologicalGroup}) if we use an apt topology, for example one can consider Diff$(X)$ a subspace of $(C^\infty(X,X),Whitney)$, where $Whitney$ denotes the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_topologies}{Whitney $C^\infty$ topology}, and endow it with the subspace topology.
\begin{rem}
    An isotopy (see \ref{Isotopy} for the definition) is equivalently a path in $\Diff(X)$.
\end{rem}

\begin{fct}
    Roations, SO(2) $\hookrightarrow \Diff^{or}(S^1)$ and this is a retraction.
\end{fct}
Thus, up to "wiggling", the map $Y \to S^1$ is unique. 

Upshot: for an oriented 1 manifold $Y$ we define 
\begin{equation}
    \Zf (Y) := A^{\# \pi_0(Y)} 
\end{equation}
and diffeos are sent to identities.%TODO what does this mean

Now what do we do on morphisms? 
%DRAWING
Just send everything to what we expect from the algebra and coalgebra structure! i.e. pants to multiplication, copants to comultiplication, cylinder to identity, cup to algebra unit, cocup to counit. Now, a morphism in the bordism category is a diffeomorphism class of oriented 2d bordisms and by the classification theorem we found that a 2d connected oriented manifold with boundary is diffeomorphic to a composition.
%DRAWING
A bordism then specifies where "in" and "outgoing" boundaries are. Since $\Zf$ must be functorial, given a composite as in the drawing, we must define $\Zf$ to be 
$$    \Zf(\Delta)....%TODO complete 
$$
Question: is this well defined?
%DRAWING

Going back to proof of classification, the local moves we had translate precisely to conditions of a Frobenius algebra. 
Subtlety: the following are not isomorphic as bordisms, while they are diffeomorphic as manifolds with boundary.
%DRAWING

We then need to specify what that bordism is sent to: 
\begin{equation}
    \Zf(..) : A \otimes A \xrightarrow{swap} A \otimes A
\end{equation}
So the classification of (possibly disconnected) 2d bordisms is simply a manifold with boundary as given from the classification of manifolds with boundary, composed with a permutation bordism, i.e. a bordism such as the following.
%DRAWING

Now, since $\Zf$ is functorial we simply set
\begin{equation}
    \Zf(...) %TODO complete
\end{equation}
and for well definedness consider the following drawing:
%DRAWING

but we see that this is true because the Frobenius algebra is commutative.

\begin{lem}
    Every (possibly non connected) 2-cobordism is a composition of 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item a "permutation bordism". i.e. given a permutation $\sigma \in S_n$, then we get a bordism $S^{1^{1\amalg_n}} \to (S^1)^{\amalg_n}$ in which the two sides have the same orientation up to interchanging components. The bordism is simply $(S^1)^{\amalg_n}$  in which on the right we use the permutation.
        %DRAWING
        \item a disjoint union of connected 2 bordisms
        \item another permutation bordism.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{lem}

\begin{prop}
    $\Bord_{2,1}^{or}$ is the symmetric monoidal category with duals generated by (under composition and disjoint union):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item one object, $S^1$.
        \item morphisms the ones we've already mentioned: cup, pants, cocup, copants, swap (and cylinder but that's just the identity).
    \end{itemize}
    with the following relations:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the cylinder is the identity, so composed with all the other bordisms it gives back the same boridsm
        \item sewing in disks 
        %DRAWING
        \item (co)associativity
        \item (co)commutativity
        \item Frobenius relations
    \end{itemize}
\end{prop}
In other words, $\Bord_{2,1}^{or}$  is free symmetric monoidal category with duals on one commutative Frobenius object $S^1$.

\subsubsection*{Usual depictions of orientations}
\label{ssub:usual_depictions_of_orientations}

%DRAWINGS

Let's now do a recap of what we've done up to now. We proved
\begin{equation}
    \TFT_{2,1}^{or}(\cat) \xrightarrow[Ev]{\simeq} \cFrob(\cat)^{\simeq}
\end{equation}
and the steps were the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the functor is well defined: on objects we get $Ev(\Zf) = \Zf(S^1)$ which is a commutative Frobenius algebra. On morphisms we get an isomorphism of commutative Frobenius algebras.
    \item $Ev$ is essentially surjective, actually we proved surjective.
    \item $Ev$ is fully faithful
\end{itemize}

\begin{rem}
    Last time we forgot about orientations...
    %TODO complete
\end{rem}

\subsubsection{Variants of TFTs}
We now provide an outlook to some research programs that are tightly connected to TFTs.
\begin{itemize}
    \item we could have used different tangential structures, such as
    \begin{itemize}
        \item unoriented bordisms. In this case we would need an isomorphism $A \cong A^\vee$ which should be an isomorphism of cummtative Frobenius algebras.
        \item framing: not many framed closed 2 manifolds
        \item spin structure
        \item conformal structure and thereby we would have studied \emph{conformal} field theories
    \end{itemize}
    \item open-closed TFTs (Lauda-Pfeiffer, \cite{Lauda_2008}): the idea is to enlarge the bordism category to include \textit{compact} 1d manifolds (not necessarily closed) and we then also have additional morphisms.
    %DRAWINGS

    Now, what structure does the line segment have? It's still a Frobenius algebra! But it's not necessarily commutative.

    \item extended TFTs (\cite{Freed_1994},\cite{Baez_1995},\cite{lurie2009classification},\cite{Calaque_2019}): one can extend TFTs downward, e.g. in 2-dimensional TFTs one might want to include the possibility of "composing" the line segment object with itself to get $S^1$. We would therefore modify the notion of symmetric monoidal category to be able to compose objects in $\Bord_{2,1,0}$. Thereby one gets a finer structure than a usual category, a.k.a. a $1$-category: objects, morphisms between objects and morphism between morphisms. The last ones are usually called 2-morphisms and the morphisms between objects are then called 1-morphisms. Objects, 1-morphisms and 2-morphisms are in this case 0-manifolds, 1-dimensional bordisms and 2 dimensional bordisms with corners. We then no longer have the structure of a category, but rather that of a weak 2-category, or bicategory. See \ref{strict nCat} for the definition of strict categories of any finite dimension, \ref{Bicategory} for the definition of a bicategory, and \ref{RemarkExtendedTFTs} for a more detailed outlook on extended TFTs.
    %TODO monoidal category as bicategory already done by defining delooping of a monoidal category /Andrea

    \item cohomological TFTs (\cite{Witten:1990bs}): aka families of $(n-1)$ manifolds and families of $n$ bordisms. In practice, fix a space $X$, then objects are $M$ closed $(n-1)$ manifolds together with $M \to X$ and morphisms are bordisms $\Sigma$ together with $\Sigma \to X$.

    Often we take $X=BG$ the classifying space of a group $G$ and having maps $M \to BG$ and $\Sigma \to BG$ gives us principle bundles on $M$ and $\Sigma$. This is connected to the field of \textit{gauge theory} and is sometimes called \textit{cohomological TFT}. 
%Unsure about adding these remarks on algebraic and arithmetic QFT and if it's BS, will ask Prof and please do check if BS /ANdrea
    
    \item arithmetic field theories (\cite{Mazur1973NotesO},\cite{kim2016arithmetic},\cite{kapustin2007electricmagnetic}, \cite{Kapranov1995},\cite{RelativeBSVDUAL}): although still very conjectural, some envision poetic connections between number theory and physics via TFTs. The original intuition behind this connection is a mysterious analogy of Barry Mazur stating that number fields form correspond to some kind of 3-dimensional manifolds and primes in such number fields behave like knots embedded in these 3-dimensional manifolds. How this connects to TFTs will become clearer after the next section, where we will have gone through the connection between the Jones polynomial (a knot invariant) and 3d-Chern-Simons theory. For instance, the spectrum\footnote{Not in the sense of a modern abelian group, which we previously described \ref{Spectra Phases of Matter}! This is the spectrum of a ring.} of the commutative ring of the integers $\mathbb{Z}$ can be seen (roughly speaking\footnote{To make this more precise Mazur talks about exotic stuff like étale cohomological dimension.}) as a 3-dimensional manifold, and since the spectra prime fields can be canonically embedded in the spectra of the integers, they are analogous to knots since knots can be defined as embeddings of $S^1$ into some 3-dimensional manifold\footnote{Often it is sufficient to pick $\R^3$ as the manifold we embed in and it is what we will do in the next section. However, taking arbitrary 3-manifolds does also make sense and in some cases, like this one, it is what one desires.}. Mazur came up with this analogy in \cite{Mazur1973NotesO}, see this \href{https://mathoverflow.net/questions/50879/what-is-the-knot-associated-to-a-prime/50995#50995}{mathoverflow comment by Lieven Lebruyn} and the \href{https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Spec%28Z%29#As3dSpaceContainingKnots}{nLab entry on Spec($\Z$)} for accessible introductions to this specific correspondence. Some (\cite{kim2016arithmetic}, \href{https://shifted-project.github.io/}{Clark Barwick's SHIFTED project} and \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXqmXKLtJrs}{this talk of his on his efforts towards geometric foundations for arithmetic field theories}) are trying to define arithmetic quantum field theories in order to apply ideas of TFTs to number theory, for example to arithmetic curves\footnote{Something from arithmetic geometry, see \cite{liu2002algebraic}}, i.e. the spectra of rings of integers in algebraic number fields. While others (\cite{Witten:1990bs},\cite{RelativeBSVDUAL}) more specifically, see a strong connection with the Langlands program. This view is summarized by the motto \emph{the Langlands program is part of the study of 4-dimensional (arithmetic, topological) quantum field theory}. For a more accessible introduction to this research program, check out these notes \cite{BenZviLanglands} by Jackson Van Dyke of a course on this topic by David Ben-Zvi.
    \item algebraic quantum field theory (\cite{Haag:1963dh}): talking about endomorphism monoids, i.e. monoids of the form $(Hom_\cat(X,X),\circ)$ (see \ref{Delooping Monoid}) we previously mentioned operator algebras, i.e. monoids and submonoids of the form $(Hom_{TopVect_{k}}(X,X),\circ)$. They are an object of interest in themselves but importantly for us algebraic quantum field theory makes extensive use of operator algebras. Algebraic quantum field theory is very roughly a way of translating the Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics (sometimes called matrix mechanics) to quantum field theory by providing an attempt to axiomatize QFT in a mathematically rigorous way. Given some apt operators on an apt topological vector space, meaning that the topological vector space can represent a quantum state and the selected operators on it can represent observables, an AQFT provides a formal assignment of algebras of such operators to regions of spacetime according to some axioms, e.g. the \href{https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Haag-Kastler+axioms}{Haag Kastler Axioms}. In this way, it pins down how observables depend of spacetime while states are being fixed, as in the Heisenberg picture. Algebraic quantum field theory can be roughly considered to be a dual to topological quantum field theory since TFTs invert the direction by assigning geometric data to algebraic ones. In fact, topological quantum field theory can be seen as a way of translating the Schrödinger picture (also called wave mechanics) to quantum field theory: states are represented by objects in the target monoidal category, the functor from $\Bord$ captures the local time evolution, and thereby a TFT shows how states are propagated through time while the observables are held fixed, as in the Schrödinger picture (see more on this at \href{https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/functorial+field+theory#QuantumMechanicsInSchroedingerPicture}{this section of the nLab entry on TFTs}). In quantum mechanics, the Heisenberg and the Schrödinger picture are two faces of the same medal, i.e. matrix mechanics and wave mechanics are equivalent\footnote{Interestingly from a historical point of view, Schrödinger's (and Eckhart's) famous proof from 1926 that the two approaches are equivalent is faulty, but von Neumann fortunately provided a foolproof demonstration in 1932. See \cite{MULLER199735} for more on this interesting trivia.}; however, we are far from proving that AQFT and TQFT are also two faces of the same medal. One point of contact between the two is via factorization algebras (something related to $E_n$-algebras, see \ref{EAlg} for the definition of a $E_1$-algebra), see \cite{costello2023factorization} for a summary on factorization algebras and how they relate to TQFT and AQFT. 
    
    In conclusion, algebraic quantum field theory is not a variant of topological field theory, but an alternative attempt to put quantum field theory on mathematically rigorous footings. One can discover more on algebraic quantum field theory in \cite{halvorson2006algebraic} and \cite{fewster2019algebraic}.

\subsection{3d TFTs} % (fold)
\label{sec:3d_tfts}

From now on the main reference will be \cite{KasselRossoTuraev97}.

For classifying TFTs in 1 and 2 dimensions the procedure we have been following is to find an algebraic category which is equivalent with such TFTs evaluated on some object. In particular, in order to classify 1d TFTs we established an equivalence with the evaluation functor of 1TFTs on a point and finite dimensional vector spaces and for 2d TFTs evaluated on the circle $S^1$ are equivalent to commutative Frobenius algebras in some symmetric monoidal category and to finite-dimensional Frobenius $k$-algebras when considering $\Vect_k$ as the target category. These equivalences of categories allow us to reconstruct 1d and 2d TFTs (up to some reasonable form of equivalence) from this purely algebraic data since they. One can ask themselves if a classification of this kind is possible also for higher dimension, such as 3d TFTs. The answer that yes! Also 3d-TFTs can be classified from algebraic data, although a bit more sophisticated than what we got in lower dimensions, we will find out that every \textit{modular tensor category} fully determines a 3d TFTs\footnote{To be rigorous, once-extended 3d TFTs, i.e. TFTs of the sort $\Bord_{3,2,1}\xrightarrow{\Zf}\cat$, are needed to prove this result. As we previously sketched, once-extended 2d TFTs have $\Bord_{2,1,0}$ as source and $\Bord_{2,1,0}$ is a symmetric monoidal bicategory (see \ref{Bicategory} and \ref{RemarkExtendedTFTs}). Also $\Bord_{3,2,1}$ is a symmetric monoidal bicategory with disjoint unions of $S^1$ as objects. In short, there is an equivalence between once-extended 3d-TFTs evaluated on the circle $S^1$ and modular tensor categories (see \cite{JordanTFTs} for more).}. The fact that we can reconstruct TFTs via these algebraic data can be summarized diagramatically as follows

The main objective of this section is to sketch how this could work and what is the relation between some special 3d TFTs, 3d Chern-Simons field theories, and the Jones polynomial, a knot invariant.


\begin{defn}
    A modular tensor category is a tensor category. A \textit{tensor} category is a monoidal linear category. A linear category is a $\Vect_k$-enriched\footnote{See \ref{FullEnrichedCat} for a rigorous definition of what enriched is and how that works for other categories.} category, i.e.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\Hom_\cat (X,Y)$ is a vector space $\forall X,Y$.
    \item composition is bilinear $\Hom_\cat (X,Y) \otimes \Hom_\cat (Y,Z) \mapsto \Hom_\cat (X,Z)$

    where a horizontal line is the identity and a crossing is the braiding $\beta$. In the drawing we simply "moved the middle string from above to below" and this is called a \textit{Reidemeister III move} in knot theory.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    Recall that $\beta$ is a \textit{natural} isomorphism, so for $U \xrightarrow{id} U$, $V \otimes W \xrightarrow{\beta_{V,W}}$ we apply the naturality of $\beta_{U,-}$ and get the following diagram:

    We may visualize this also via string diagrams:
    %DIAGRAM
    we get exactly the same drawing! However, algebraically, the proof is not finished. We now apply 
    \begin{equation}
        (id_Y \otimes \beta_{X,Z}) \circ (\beta_{X,Y} \otimes id_Z) = \beta_{X,Y\otimes Z}
    \end{equation}
    which inserted for $\beta_{U, V \otimes W}$ and $\beta_{W \otimes V, U}$ gives the result.
\end{proof}

Now, what happens if we take $U=V=W$? Let $\beta:= \beta_{V,V}$, we now get
\begin{equation}
    (\beta \otimes id)\circ (id \otimes \beta)\circ (\beta \otimes id)= (id \otimes \beta) \circ (\beta \otimes id) \circ (id \otimes \beta)

    Let $V$ be a vector space, $c \in \Aut(V \otimes V)$. The YBE for $c$ is 
    \begin{equation}
        (c \otimes id)\circ (id \otimes c)\circ (c \otimes id)= (id \otimes c) \circ (c \otimes id) \circ (id \otimes c)
    \end{equation}
    A solution to the YBE is called $R$-matrix.

    In coordinates, for $v_i$ a basis of $V$, if
    \begin{equation}
        c (v_i \otimes v_j) = \sum_{k,l} c_{ij}^{kl} v_k \otimes v_l
    \end{equation}
    then the YBE is given by
    \begin{equation}
        \sum_{p,q,y} c_{ij}^{pq}c_{qk}^{yn}c_{py}^{ln}=\sum_{y,q,r}c^{qr}_{jk}c^{ly}_{iq}c^{mn}_{yr}
    \end{equation}
\end{defn}
Theorem \ref{thm:YB_braid} then tells us that, for \textit{any} $V\in\Vect$, $\beta_{V,V}$ is an $R$-matrix.

\begin{ex}
    the automorphism on $V\in\Vect$: $V \otimes V \xrightarrow{swap} V \otimes V$ satisfies the YBE because
    \begin{itemize}
        \item it comes from a standard braiding $\beta$ in $\Vect$
        \item Coxeter relation in $S_3$: $$(12)(23)(12)=(23)(12)(23)$$
    \end{itemize}

    $V$ finite dimensional vector space with basis $e_1, \dots, e_n$ and $q$ an invertible scalar. Now define $c_q (e_i \otimes e_j):= q e_i \otimes e_j $ for $i=j$, $e_j \otimes e_i$ for $i<j$ and $e_j \otimes e_i + (q-q') e_i \otimes e_j$ for $i>j$. A computation then shows that this satisfies the YBE. Note that $c_1 = swap$ is a 1-parameter "deformation" of swap.
\end{ex}

This comes from representation theory!
\begin{defn}
    Let $G$ be a group, a representation of $G$ on $V$ a vector space (or $R$ module) is a group homomorphism $\rho: G \to \Aut(V)$, i.e.
    \begin{equation}
        \rho(gh) = \rho(g) \rho(h), \quad \forall g,h \in G
    \end{equation}
    Now, a morphism of representations $\rho_i: G \to \Aut(V_i), i=1,2$ is a linear map $\alpha: V_1 \to V_2$ such that the following diagram commutes:
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            V_1 \ar[r, "\alpha"] \ar[d, "\rho_1(g)"'] & V_2 \ar[d, "\rho_2(g)"]\\
            V_1 \ar[r, "\alpha"'] & V_2 
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{equation}
    This gives rise to the category of representations of $G$, $\Rep_G$.
\end{defn}
\begin{ex}
    Symmetries of a polygon: $G=D_n$ dihedral group and $\rho: D_n \to \Aut(\R^2)$, where $D_n \acts \R^2$ with reflections and rotations.
\end{ex}

Solutions of YBE give representations of the braid group, which we now recall.

\subsubsection{The braid group and the Braid category} % (fold)
\label{ssub:the_braid_group}

\begin{defn}\label{defn:braid_group}
    Let $k\geq 3$. The braid group $B_k$ with $k$ strands has $k-1$ generators $\sigma_1, \dots, \sigma_{k-1}$ and 2 relations:
    \begin{flalign}
        \label{eq:braid_relations}
        \quad
        \begin{matrix*}[l]
            1.\;\sigma_i \sigma_j  = \sigma_j \sigma_i &\text{if} \quad |i-j|>1 \\
            2.\;\sigma_i \sigma_{i+1} \sigma_i = \sigma_{i+1} \sigma_i \sigma_{i+1} &\text{if}\quad 1\leq i<k-1 \\
        \end{matrix*}&&
    \end{flalign}
    % \begin{enumerate}
    %     \item $\sigma_i \sigma_j = \sigma_j \sigma_i$ if $|i-j|>1$
    %     \item $\sigma_i \sigma_{i+1} \sigma_i = \sigma_{i+1} \sigma_i \sigma_{i+1}$ for $1\leq i<k-1$
    % \end{enumerate}
    In addition $B_2$ is the free group on one generator $\sigma$, i.e. it is isomorphic to $\Z$ and $B_1 = B_0 = {e}$.
\end{defn}
The reason we call $B_k$ the braid group with $k$ strands is that we can picture the elements $\sigma_i$ in the following way:
%DRAWING

\begin{rem}
    There is a surjective homomorphism
    \begin{equation}
        B_k \to S_k
    \end{equation}
    which is clear since $S_k$ has the same generators and relations with in addition $\sigma_i^2=e$.
\end{rem}

\begin{prop}
    Let $c \in \Aut(V \otimes V)$ be an $R$ matrix (i.e. a solution of the YBE). Then, for any $k >0$, there is a unique homomorphism $\rho_k^c: B_k \to \Aut(V^{\otimes k})$ (i.e. a representation of $B_k$ on $\Aut(V^{\otimes k})$) such that
    \begin{equation}
        \rho_k^c (\sigma_i):= c_i, \quad i=1, \dots, k-1
    \end{equation}
    with the $c_i\in \Aut(V^{\otimes k})$ is defined as: take $c$ in position $i, i+1$ and id otherwise, i.e.
    \begin{equation}
        c_i := 
        \begin{cases}
            c \otimes id_{V^{\otimes(k-2)}}, &i=1 \\
            id_{V^{\otimes(i-1)}} \otimes c \otimes id_{V^{\otimes(...)}}, & 1<i<k-1 \\
            id_{V^{\otimes(k-2)}} \otimes c, & i=k-1    
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
\end{prop}
% so R matrices give us representations of the Braid groups, is the converse also true?
\begin{rem}
    With this notation, YBE reads as 
    \begin{equation}
        c_1 c_2 c_1 = c_2 c_1 c_2
    \end{equation}
\end{rem}

\begin{proof}
    Define $\rho_k^c (\sigma_i):= c_i$ and check that the $c_i$ satisfy the relations in Definition \ref{defn:braid_group}. 

    For (1)...

    Then (2) follows from the YBE written in terms of $c_1$ and $c_2$.

%TODO check reference for names...
\begin{defn}
    Let $\uConf_k(\R^2) \subset (\R^2)^k$ (the ordered configuration space of $\R^2$) be the subspace of $k$-tuples $(x_1, \dots, x_k)$ such that $x_i \neq x_j$ for $i\neq j$.
    Then we have an action $S_k \acts \uConf_k(\R^2)$. 
    The \textit{unordered} configuration space is $\Conf_k(\R^2) := \uConf_k(\R^2)/S_k$.
\end{defn}

Distinguished configuration... %TODO complete

We have a homomorphism $B \to \pi_1(\Conf_k(\R^2), p)$ which sends $\sigma_i \mapsto \hat \sigma_i = [f_i]$ where $f^i$ is a loop at $p = [(1, 2, )]$ in $(\R^2)^k$, given by:
\begin{align}
    f^i &= (f_1^i, \dots, f_k^i): [0,1] \to (\R^2)^k \cong \C^k\\
    f^i_j(s) &= j, \quad \text{if } j \neq i, i+1 \\
    f^i_i(s) &= \frac{1}{2} (2i+1 - e^{\pi i s}) \\
    f^i_{i+1}(s) &= \frac{1}{2} (2i+1 - e^{\pi i s}) 
\end{align}
this indeed induces a loop in $\Conf_k (\R^2)$.

For it to be a homomorphism we need to check that the images of $\sigma_i$ satisfy the relations \ref{eq:braid_relations} of the $B_k$ group.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\hat\sigma_i \hat\sigma_j = \hat\sigma_j \hat\sigma_i$ for $|i-j|>1$
    %TODO drawing and explanation
    \item $\hat\sigma_i \hat\sigma_{i+1} \hat\sigma_i = \hat\sigma_{i+1} \hat\sigma_i \hat\sigma_{i+1}$ for $1\leq i<k-1$
\end{enumerate}

The following important result can be found in "The theory of braids", by Artin in 1947. %TODO put it as reference
\begin{thm}
    This homomorphism $\phi: B_k \to \pi_1 (\Conf_k(\R^2),p)$ is an isomorphism.
\end{thm}

Given a representative $f = (f_1, \dots, f_k): [0,1] \to (\R^2)^k$ of an element in $\pi_1(\Conf_k(\R^2),p)$
\begin{equation}
    L_f = \bigcup_{j=1}^k \{(s, f_i(s): s \in [0,1]\} \subseteq [0,1] \times \R^2
\end{equation}
Note now that
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\de L_f = \{0,1\} \times \{1,2, \dots, k\}$
    \item $\forall s \in [0,1]$ we have that $L_f \cap (\{s\} \times \R^2) = k$ points.
    \item $L_f$ is a bordism from $\{1,\dots, k\}$ to itself. Where in addition we can add an orientation by "flowing" from 0 to 1.
    \item group structure gives the composition of bordisms.
    \item always have just $\bullet_1, \dots, \bullet_k$ as source/target $\implies$ can take just this object.
    \item bordism $L_f$ comes with an embedding into $[0,1] \times \R^2$. This really depends on the representative! But the bordism itself only depends on $[f] \in \pi_1(\Conf_k(\R^2))$.
    %DRAWING
\end{enumerate}

This allows us to define the following category:
We can now define the category :
\begin{defn}
    The $\Braid$ category is given by:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item objects: natural numbers $0, 1, \dots, k, \dots$
        \item morphisms: 
            \begin{equation}
                 \Hom_{\Braid}(k,l) = 
                 \begin{cases}
                     \emptyset & \text{if } k \neq l \\
                     \text{isotopy classes of "braids" from $k$ to $k$} & \text{if } k = l
                 \end{cases}
                 %& \emptyset\quad \text{if } k \neq l\\
                 %& \text{isotopy classes of "braids" from $k$ to $k$}
             \end{equation} 
             By braids we mean a "permutation 1 bordism together with an embedding" $\bigcup_{\{1, \dots, k\}} [0,1] \hookrightarrow [0,1] \times \R^2$ such that 1 and 2 hold.
         \item composition is "stacking the pictures", i.e. composition of bordisms plus stacking embeddings (using $[0,1] \cup_{1=0} [0,1] \cong [0,1]$). 
         \item braided monoidal structure given by stacking $\R^2$s next to each other (using embedding $\R^2 \amalg \R^2 \cong [0,1]^2 \amalg [0,1]^2 \hookrightarrow \R^2 \cong [0,1]^2$).
    \end{itemize}
\end{defn}

\begin{exercise}
    One could now prove that $\Braid \simeq \coprod_{k\geq 0} B_k$, where $\coprod_{k\geq 0} B_k$ was in one of the exercise sheets. 
\end{exercise}

\subsubsection{Expanding the Braid category: the Tangle category} % (fold)
\label{ssub:expanding_the_braid_category_the_tangle_category}

Next step: allow more morphisms, namely all bordisms, together with suitable embeddings.
\begin{defn}
    A tangle with $k$ inputs and $l$ outputs is a 1 dimensional bordism $\Sigma$ from $k$ to $l$ points together with $\Sigma \hookrightarrow [0,1] \times \R^2$ smooth embedding, such that
    \begin{align}
        \de_{in} \Sigma &= \{(0,1), (0,2), \dots, (0,k)\}\\
        \de_{out} \Sigma &=\{(1,1), (1,2), \dots, (1,l)\}
    \end{align}
\end{defn}
%DRAWING example

We can now define the tangle category, of which $\Braid$ will be a (braided monoidal) subcategory.
\begin{defn}
    The tangle category $\Tang_1$ has:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item objects: natural numbers
        \item morphisms: 
        \begin{equation}
            \Hom_{\Tang}(k,l) = \{\text{isotopy classes of tangles from $k$ to $l$ points}\}
            %TODO specify somewhere what we mean by isotopy
        \end{equation}
        \item composition of underlying bordisms and stacking embeddings using $[0,1] \cup_{1=0} [0,1] \hookrightarrow [0,1]$
        \item braided monoidal structure as before
    \end{itemize}
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
    Let $(\cat, \otimes)$ be a monoidal category and $X \in \cat$. We say that $Y$ is a right dual of $X$ if there is 
    \begin{align}
        ev_X&: Y \otimes X \to 1 \\
        coev_X&: 1 \to X \otimes Y
    \end{align}
    such that the snake relations are satisfied. We then say that $X$ is a left dual of $Y$. See \ref{DefDualObj} for a complete defintition.
\end{defn}

\begin{lem}
    In $\Tang$, every object has a left and a right dual.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
    Same pictures as for $\Bord_1$.
\end{proof}

% -------------------------------------------------------------
% ---------------------- LECTURE 18 15/1 ----------------------
% -------------------------------------------------------------

%TODO probably already written
\begin{defn}
    A tangle with $k$ inputs and $l$ outputs is a one dimensional bordism $\Sigma$ from $k$ points to $l$ points together with a smooth embedding $\Sigma \hookrightarrow [0,1] \times \R^2$ such that
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\de_{in} \Sigma = \{(0,1), (0,2), \dots , (0,k)\}$
        \item $\de_{out} \Sigma = \{(1,1), (1,2), \dots , (1,l)\}$
    \end{itemize}
    This gives a braided monoidal category $\Tang_1 \supset \Braid$.
\end{defn}
% DRAWING

We can now define the concept of a framing on a tangle, which is different from what we previously meant as framing.
\begin{defn}
    A framing on a tangle  is a nonvanishing normal vector field on the tangle such that at the in-boundary and at the out-boundary it "points up".
\end{defn}
This definition is made clearer through examples:
\begin{ex}
    ...
    %DRAWING
\end{ex}

If we add a framing to the definition above we then get the \textit{framed} tangle category $\Tang_1^{fr}$.

In fact, on the line segment as a bordism between two points we have \Z many non isotopic framings corresponding to the \textit{winding number} of normal vector fields. Similarly, $S^1$ has \Z many framings. 

We noted last time that $\Tang_1$ has left and right duals, one can check now that $\Tang_1^{fr}$ also does. We see that the framed tangle category is very similar but it has \Z many morphisms between two points, instead of just one. This idea can be generalized with the concept of a ribbon category:
\begin{defn}
    A ribbon category is a braided monoidal category \cat in which:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item every object $X$ has a right dual $X^\vee$, thus satisfying  $$ev_X : X^\vee \otimes X \to 1$$ $$coev_X: 1 \to X \otimes X^\vee$$ which satisfies the snake relations/triangle identities, (\textit{right rigid category})
        \item there is a pivotal structure, that is a  monoidal isomorphism
        \begin{equation}
            w: id_\cat \to ( \enskip)^{\vee\vee}
        \end{equation}
        (these two properties are the defining ones for a \textit{pivotal category})
        \item For any object $X$, we have a "twist"
        \begin{equation}
            \vartheta_X = (id \otimes ev_{X^\vee}) \circ (\beta_{X,X} \otimes id) \circ( id_X \otimes coev_X)
        \end{equation}
        This satisfies 
        \begin{equation}
            ((\vartheta_X)^\ast ) = \vartheta_{X^\vee}
        \end{equation}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

Here we're using an abuse of notation, by identifying $X^{\vee \vee}$ with $X$.
%TODO diagram

\begin{ex}
    In $\Tang_1^{fr}$, the $\vartheta$ is exactly the picture with the blackboard framing. It remains to check property 3.
\end{ex}

The definition of the dual of a map $f: X \to Y$ was given in \ref{DualMorph} and is given by the following composition:
$$f^\vee:Y^\vee\xrightarrow{id_{Y^\vee} \otimes coev_X}Y^\vee\otimes X \otimes X^\vee\xrightarrow{id_Y^\vee\otimes f\otimes id_{X^\vee}}Y^\vee\otimes Y\otimes X^\vee\xrightarrow{ev_Y\otimes id_{X^\vee}}X^\vee$$

\begin{ex}
\hfill
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\Vect_k^{finite dim}$ is a ribbon category with the usual tensor product and braiding.
        \item $\Mod_R^{fpp}$ is a ribbon category, where $fpp$ stands for finitely presented and projective and $R$ is a ring or $k$ algebra.
    \end{itemize}
    we would then also like some more examples, which are braided but \textit{not} symmetric.
\end{ex}

Given an algebra $A$, then $A-\Mod$ is a category. Now, which extra structure on $A$ guarantees that $A-\Mod^{f.d.}$ is ribbon?

\begin{lem}
    Let \cat be a pivotal category. Then every object has a left dual $({}^\vee X, \tilde{ev}_X, \tilde{coev}_X)$, the twist is invertible and natural in $X$ and $\vartheta_1 = id_1$ and
    \begin{equation}
        \vartheta_{X \otimes Y} = \beta_{Y,X} \circ \beta_{X,Y} \circ \vartheta_X \otimes \vartheta_Y
    \end{equation}
\end{lem}

We now consider a variation of a tangle category. 
\begin{defn}
    Let \cat be a ribbon category. $\Tang_1^{fr}(\cat)$ is the following ribbon category, in which we "decorate with objects in \cat".
    \begin{itemize}
        \item objects: finite sequences
            \begin{equation}
                (V_1, \epsilon_1), \dots, (V_k, \epsilon_k)
            \end{equation}
            where $V_i \in \cat$ and $\epsilon_i = \pm 1$. This corresponds to $k$ points in $\Tang_1^{fr, or}$ in which $\epsilon$ gives us the orientation of each point.
        \item morphisms: has underlying (isotopy classes of) framed oriented tangles + each component is labelled by $V \in \cat$ such that the source and target are labelled by $(V, \pm 1)$.
        \item Composition is stacking pictures but only if the labels match up.
    \end{itemize}
    The "correspondence" above is actually a forgetful functor $\Tang_1^{fr}(\cat) \to \Tang_1^{fr, or}$, which $or$ means adding an orientation to the bordism.
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}
    If \cat is a ribbon category, then there is a unique braided monoidal functor $F : \Tang_1^{fr} (\cat) \to \cat$ such that
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $F(V, +1) = V$ and $F(V, -1) = V^\vee$
        \item $\forall V, W \in \cat$ we have:
        %DRAWING
    \end{itemize}
\end{prop}

Finally, what does all this have to do with 3d TFTs? 
%TODO diagram

We will use:
\begin{itemize}
    \item every 3 manifold arises from framed 1-tangles via \textit{surgery},
    \item two tangles giving the same 3-manifold can be related by \textit{Kirby moves},
    \item $F_\cat$ is invariant under Kirby moves if \cat is a \textit{modular} tensor category.

\subsubsection{Interlude on knots, links and the Kones polynomial} % (fold)
\label{sub:interlude_on_knots_links_and_the_kones_polynomial}

\begin{ex}
%DRAWING
    Examples of knots are the following:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the \textit{unknot}
        \item the \textit{trefoil} knot
        \item the \textit{figure 8} knot
    \end{itemize}
    and of links:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the Hopf link
        \item the Borromean rings
    \end{itemize}
\end{ex}

\begin{defn}
    A link is a finite collection of circles smoothly embedded in $\R^3$: 
    \begin{equation}
        \coprod_{i=1}^k S^1 \hookrightarrow \R^3
    \end{equation}
\end{defn}
In which smoothness is to exclude some pathological situations.
%DRAWING
\begin{defn}
    A knot is a link with one component ($k=1$).
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
    Two links $L_1, L_2: \amalg_{i=1}^k S^1 \hookrightarrow \R^3$ are equivalent if there exists an ambient isotopy between them, i.e. $H: \R^3 \times [0,1] \to \R^3$ such that
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $H(-,0) = id$
        \item $\forall t \in [0,1], \; H(-,t)$ is a diffeomorphism
        \item $H(-,1) \circ L_1 = L_2$
    \end{itemize}
\end{defn}

A goal of knot theory is to find an invariant of knots/links, i.e. an assignment
\begin{equation}
    \{\text{knots/links}\} \to \R, \Z[A,A^{-1}],\dots
\end{equation}
such that if two links are equivalent we get the same number, polynomial, $\dots$.

A link invariant is complete if it detects when 2 links are/are not equivalent.

Concretely, we represent links and nots by 2d drawings, these drawings are called \textit{Link diagrams}. Let $L$ be a link and $p:\R^3 \to \R^2$ a projection.
\begin{defn}
    $p(L)$ is regular if 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item every point has at most 2 preimages in $L$
        \item intersections are transversal
    \end{enumerate}
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
    A link diagram is a regular $p(L)$ together with over/under information at each crossing.
\end{defn}
\begin{rem}
    Given a link, we do \textit{not} always get a link diagram $p(L)$, but we can always deform/perturb the embedding $L: \coprod_{i=1}^k S^1 \hookrightarrow \R^3$ by ambient isotopy to $L'$ which gives a link diagram.
\end{rem}

Want to define a knot/link invariant by defining something on link diagrams. In order to do this we introduce Reidemeister moves, which are the following local changes in a link diagram:
\begin{itemize}
    \item (I or R1) %DRAWING
    \item (II or R2) %DRAWING
    \item (III or R3) %DRAWING
\end{itemize}

\begin{thm}[Reidemeister]
    Two links are equivalent if and only if their link diagrams are the same up to finitely many Reidemeister moves and isotopy in $\R^2$.
\end{thm}
This theorem is very important because it tells us that the link diagrams have all the information of the equivalence class of the link, so to determine (in)equivalence we can work with link diagrams.

A first knot invariant is the "number of tricolorings": we color a link diagram with three colors according to the following rules
\begin{itemize}
    \item each strand is one color
    \item at each crossing either all three strands are the same color, or they're all different.
\end{itemize}
\begin{ex}
    There are always three trivial colorings, the monochromatic ones. For the unknot, these are the only three tricolorings, while for the trefoil there is an additional one:
    %DRAWING

    This shows that the trefoil knot is \textit{not} equivalent to the unknot.
\end{ex}
In order to prove that it is a knot invariant one should check that it is invariant under Reidemeister moves.

We now finally get to the Jones polynomial, found by Jones in 1984, and this presentation is from Kauffmann in 1987. The motivation for it comes from operator algebras and the braid group representations. 
\begin{defn}
    The Kauffmann bracket of a link diagram $D$ is a Laurent polynomial $\langle D\rangle \in \Z[A,A^{-1}]$ defined by
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\langle 0\rangle = 1$
        \item ...%TODO complete
    \end{itemize}
\end{defn}
\begin{ex}
    ....
    %DRAWING
\end{ex}
This shows that the Kauffmann bracket is \textit{not} a knot invariant, in particular it is not invariant under R1. It \textit{is} however invariant under R2 and R3, in fact the coefficients in the definition of the bracket are exactly the ones that preserve R2 and R3.

From now on: links are oriented, meaning $S^1$ comes with an orientation. So we can talk about oriented link invariants, for which we have oriented Reidemeister moves. 

Now we would like to fix the problem with the Kauffmann bracket. 
\begin{defn}
    The sign of a crossing is 
    %DRAWING
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
    The writhe of an oriented link diagram $D$ is the sum of the signs of the crossings:
    \begin{equation}
        w(D) = \sum_{c \text{ crossing in } D} \sign(c)
    \end{equation}
\end{defn}

\begin{lem}
    The writhe is also invariant under R2 and R3, and changes under R1 as ...
    %DRAWING
\end{lem}

\begin{defn}
    For any link $L$, define $\chi (L) = (-A^3)^{-w(p(L))} \langle p(L)\rangle \in \Z[A^{-1},A]$
\end{defn}
\begin{thm}
    This is a link invariant.
\end{thm}

\begin{ex}

\begin{defn}
    For any unoriented link $L$, the Jones polynomial of $L$ is 
    \begin{equation}
        V(L) = \chi(L)|_{A=t^{1/4}} \in \Z[t^{-1/2},t^{1/2}]
    \end{equation}
\end{defn}

Explanation of problem of the Kauffmann bracket with R1:
\begin{defn}[Alternative]
    A framed link is (a link together with a nonvanishing normal vector field as before) the image of a smooth embedding of $\coprod_{i=1}^k S^ \times [0,1] \hookrightarrow \R^3$.
\end{defn}
\begin{rem}
    This can be projected onto $\R^2$ such that annuli are "flat", this is the "blackboard framing" from previously.
\end{rem}
\begin{ex}
    We can give two framings on the unknot which are not equivalent:
    %DRAWING
\end{ex}
\begin{thm}
    $L,L'$ framed links, $D,D'$ diagrams thereof using blackboard framings. Then $L \sim L'$ (isotopy equivalence with framing) if and only if $D$ is related to $D'$ via R2, R3 and the modification of R1 given by
    %DRAWING
\end{thm}
\begin{thm}
    The Kauffmann bracket is a framed link invariant.
\end{thm}
Recall we had $\Tang_1^{or,fr}(\cat) \to \cat$ where \cat is a ribbon category. Now, fix a $V \in \cat$, we get an injection $\Link^{or,fr} \hookrightarrow \Tang_1^{or,fr}(\cat)$ in which we decorate each strand (component) by $V$. The goal is then to find a specific ribbon category \cat such that we get back the Jones polynomial. We'll find $\cat = U_q\sl_2 -Mod^{f.d.}$.


\subsubsection{Making \texorpdfstring{$A-\Mod^{f.d.}$}{A-Mod f.d.} into a ribbon category} % (fold)
\label{ssub:making_}

%Back to algebra: How to get a ribbon category?
We now want to add additional structures on an algebra $A$ in such a way that $A-\Mod^{f.d.}$ becomes a ribbon category.
%why do we want to do this?
We therefore need $A-\Mod^{f.d.}$ to have the following structures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item monoidal structure,
    \item existence of (right) duals (right rigidity),
    \item braiding,
    \item pivotal structure,
    \item twist,
\end{itemize}
which we gradually construct in this order. 

\subsubsection*{Monoidal structure} % (fold)

In order to do this, we will need additional structures on $A$, starting with the following.
\begin{defn}
    A Hopf algebra in a braided strict monoidal category \cat is 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item a bialgebra $(H,\mu,\eta,\Delta,\epsilon)$, in which we represent all these maps as the following drawings
        %DRAWING

        These maps should satisfy
        \begin{equation}
            (\mu \otimes \mu) \circ( id \otimes \beta \otimes id) \circ (\Delta \otimes \Delta) = \Delta \circ \mu
        \end{equation}
        and
        %TODO complete
        \item antipode map $S: H \to H$ depicted as 
        %DRAWING

        satisfying
        %DRAWING
    \end{itemize}
\end{defn}
\begin{ex}
    \item Take $H = k[G]$, 
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{matrix}
            \mu(g,h) = gh\quad & \eta(1) = 1\quad & \\
            \Delta(g) = g \otimes g\quad & \epsilon(g) = 1\quad & s(g)  = g^{-1} 
        \end{matrix}
    \end{equation}
    \item for Lie algebra \g, let $U\g$ be its universal enveloping algebra, which we will define shortly. We then have
    \begin{equation}
        \Rep^{f.d.} G \simeq U\g-\Mod^{f.d.}
    \end{equation}
    we will then "deform" this in one of the exercises.
\end{ex}

Recall that a Lie algebra is defined as follows.
\begin{defn}
    A Lie algebra is a vector space with a bilinear map $[-,-]: \g \otimes \g \to \g$, sending $x \otimes y \mapsto [x,y]$, called the Lie bracket, satisfying:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item anticommutativity: $[x,x]=0$ or $[x,y] = -[y,x]$
        \item Jacobi identity: $[x,[y,z]] + [y,[z,x]] + [z,[x,y]] = 0$
    \end{itemize}
    A homomorphism of Lie algebras $\g, \mathfrak h$ is a linear map $\phi: \g \to \mathfrak h$ such that $\phi([x,y]_\g) = [\phi(x), \phi(y)]_{\mathfrak h}$.
\end{defn}
\begin{ex}
\hfill
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\g = \End(V) = \gl_V$, with bracket given by the commutator $[f,g] = f \circ g - g \circ f$. There is also a sub Lie algebra $\sl_V:=\{f \in \gl_V : \tr f = 0\}$.

        If for example we take $V = \R^2$ we have $\gl_2 = \Mat_{2,2}$ and $\sl_2 = \{A \in \Mat_{2,2}: \tr A = 0\}$.
        \item Let $A$ be an associative algebra, then if we take the underlying vector space, with bracket given by the commutator, we get a Lie algebra. In other words, there is a forgetful functor:
        \begin{equation}
            \Alg \to \Lie
        \end{equation}
        and its left adjoint is the concept of universal enveloping algebra which we will see more explicitly later on.
        \item %TODO complete
        \item smooth vector fields on a smooth manifold: $\mathfrak{X} = \Der(\C^\infty(M))$ %TODO weird letter
    \end{enumerate}
\end{ex}
Outlook: in physics we like to look at Lie groups, a smooth manifold with a group structure (i.e. a group object in the category of smooth manifolds). Since it's a manifold, we can look at its tangent space. The Lie algebra $\g$ of $G$ is defined as $T_e G$. %left invariant vector fields....

Now, fix \g a Lie algebra.
\begin{defn}
    The tensor algebra of \g is the (graded) algebra given by:
    \begin{equation}
        T(\g) := \bigoplus_{n=0}^\infty \g^{\otimes n}
    \end{equation}
    with $\g^{\otimes n} \otimes \g^{\otimes k} \to \g^{\otimes(n+k)}$.

    There is a 2 sided ideal $I(\g) \subset T(\g)$ generated by $\langle x \otimes y - y \otimes x - [x,y] \rangle$. We can then define the universal enveloping algebra of \g:
    \begin{equation}
        U\g := T(\g)/I(\g)
    \end{equation}
\end{defn}
The universal enveloping algebra has the universal property that given an algebra $A$ and a Lie algebra map $\g \to A$ there is a unique map $U \g \to A$ making the following diagram commute
\begin{equation}
    \begin{tikzcd}[nodes in empty cells=true]
        \g \ar[dr]\ar[r] & U\g \ar[d, dashed] \\
        & A
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}

\begin{clm}
    $U\g$ is a Hopf algebra, with coalgebra structure given by:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\Delta: U\g \to U\g \otimes U\g$ %TODO complete
        \item $\epsilon: U\g  \to k$
        \item $S: U\g \to U\g$
    \end{itemize}
\end{clm}
In general, we'll now see that if $A$ is a Hopf algebra, then $A-\Mod^{f.d.}$ is a monoidal category with duals.

\begin{thm}
    Let $(A,\mu,\eta)$ be a unital associative algebra and $\Delta:A \to A \otimes A, \epsilon:A \to k$ linear maps. Then $(A,\mu,\eta, \Delta, \epsilon)$ is a bialgebra if and only if $(A-\Mod, \otimes , (k,\epsilon))$ is monoidal.
\end{thm}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let $M,N$ be $A-$modules, then the vector space $M\otimes N$ is an $A-$module via 
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            A \ar[r, "\Delta"] & A \otimes A \ar[r] & \End(M) \otimes \End(N) \ar[r] & \End(M \otimes N)
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{equation}
    \item $(k,\epsilon)$ is an $A-$module via
    \begin{equation}
        A \xrightarrow{\epsilon} \End(k) \cong k
    \end{equation}
    \item associators and unitors are those from $\Vect$.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Rigidity} % (fold)

%Schweigert cor 2.5.17 says kind of the opposite, I ALWAYS have a right dual and only have a left dual if S is invertible
\begin{prop}\label{prop:Hopf2}
    Let $H$ be a Hopf algebra and $M$ an $H-$module, then $M^\vee:=\Hom(M,k)$ has an $H$ action via the transpose of $S$, i.e. given $\phi \in \Hom(M,k),\,a \in H$ we get $a \cdot \phi \in \Hom(M,k)$ given by
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:dual_mod_struct}
        (a \cdot \phi) (m):= \phi(s(a) \cdot m)
    \end{equation}
    This is a left dual if $M$ is finite dimensional.
    Now, if $S$ is invertible, ${}^\vee M = \Hom(M,k)$ with $(a \cdot \phi)(m) := \phi(s^{-1}(a)\cdot m)$ is a right dual if $M$ is finite dimensional.
\end{prop}

\begin{cor}
    If $H$ is a Hopf algebra with $S$ invertible, then $H-\Mod^{f.d.}$ is rigid monoidal.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}[Idea of proof of Proposition \ref{prop:Hopf2}]
    Check that $ev_M, coev_M$ exhibiting dual in $\Vect$ are $H-$module maps.
\end{proof}

% Outlook: To get a ribbon category we need:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item braiding
%     \item pivotal structure
%     \item twist
% \end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Braiding} 
Recall: we want a ribbon category and we had a Hopf algebra, so we had a monoidal category with duals.

We're now using \cite{SchwHopfQuantumTFT} as a reference.

\begin{defn}
    A quasi-triangular structure on a bi/Hopf algebra is a "universal $R$-matrix", i.e. an invertible element $R \in A \otimes A$ such that $\forall x \in A$ with 
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            \Delta^{coop}: A \ar[r, "\Delta"] & A \otimes A \ar[r, "\tau_{A,A}"] & A \otimes A
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{equation}
    the following are satisfied
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\Delta^{coop}(x) R  = R \Delta(x)$, and
        \item In $A^{\otimes 3}$ we have 
        \begin{align}
            (\Delta \otimes id_A)(R) = R_{13} R_{23} 
        \end{align}
        \item 
        \begin{equation}
            (id_A \otimes \Delta)(R) = R_{13} R_{12}
        \end{equation}
        in which $R_{12} = R \otimes 1, R_{23} = 1 \otimes R, R_{13} = (\tau_{A,A} \otimes id_A)(1 \otimes R)$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

\begin{ex}
    Any cocommutative bi/Hopf algebra has a canonical $R$ matrix, $R = 1\otimes 1$, since the first relation simply becomes $\Delta = \Delta^{coop}$, which is exactly the cocommutativity.
\end{ex}

\begin{prop}[4.2.3. in \cite{SchwHopfQuantumTFT}]
    Let $A$ be a bialgebra. Then a braiding on $A-\Mod^{(f.d.)}$ uniquely determines a quasitriangular structure on $A$ and viceversa. 
    % This is what we're trying to do: add structures on A so that A-Mod has more structure.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}[Proof strategy: ]
    Given a braiding $\beta$, define the universal $R$ matrix to be
    \begin{equation}
        R:=\tau_{A,A}(\beta_{A,A}(1_A \otimes 1_A))
    \end{equation}
    in which $\tau_{A,A}$ is the flip and $\beta_{A,A}$ is the braiding. Then one can check properties 1. 2. and 3. above. 

    Now, the following is also true:
    \begin{clm}
        Given $R$ as above, the braiding can be recovered as follows: $\beta_{U,V} (u \otimes v) = \tau_{U,V}(R(u \otimes v))$, for arbitrary $U, V \in A-\Mod$.
    \end{clm}
    So this motivates that if we are given a universal $R$ matrix, we should define $\beta$ as such, and one should check that it's actually a braiding.
\end{proof}

Main example: $U_q\sl_2$, Hopf algebra, not cocommutative but has a universal $R$ matrix. Therefore $U_q\sl_2 - \Mod$ is braided monoidal. We get $U_q\sl_2$ from the cocommutative Hopf algebra $U\sl_2$ by "deforming" it.

$U_q\sl_2$ is a $\C(q)$-algebra generators $E,F,K,K^{-1}$ with relations:
\begin{align*}
    KK^{-1} &= K^{-1}K = 1 \\
    KEK^{-1} &= q^2 E \\
    KFK^{-1} &= q^{-2}F \\
    [E,F] &= \frac{K - K^{-1}}{q - q^{-1}}
\end{align*}
We have an important 2 dimensional module ("representation") for $U_q\sl_2$: $V_1 \cong \C^2$ with basis $V_1, V_{-1}$. Now, how does $U_q\sl_2$ act? In this basis we write:
\begin{align*}
    E &=
    \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & 1 \\
        0 & 0 
    \end{pmatrix} \\
    F &= 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & 0 \\
        1 & 0 
    \end{pmatrix} \\
    K &= 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        q & 0 \\
        0 & q^{-1} 
    \end{pmatrix} 
\end{align*}

We also claimed there was a Hopf algebra structure, which we now make explicit. The comultiplication is given by
\begin{align*}
    \Delta(E) &= 1\otimes E + E \otimes K \\
    \Delta(F) &= K^{-1} \otimes F + F \otimes 1 \\
    \Delta(K) &= K \otimes K \\
    \Delta(K^{-1}) &= K^{-1} \otimes K^{-1}
\end{align*}
the counit map:
\begin{align*}
    \epsilon(E) &= \epsilon(F) = 0 \\
    \epsilon(K) &= \epsilon(K^{-1}) = 1
\end{align*}
and we should check that these satisfy the required relations. In addition we need the antipode map:
\begin{align*}
    S(E) &= -EK^{-1}\\
    S(F) &= -KF \\
    S(K) &= K^{-1} \\
    S(K^{-1}) &= K
\end{align*}
We then get the monoidal category $U_q \sl_2-\Mod$. If $U,V$ are objects in $U_q \sl_2-\Mod$, then so is $U\otimes V$ in which we have
\begin{equation}
    E(u \otimes v) = E_U \otimes K_V + U \otimes E_V
\end{equation}
It is also braided... %TODO complete

From $S$ we get the dual of $V_1$: as vector space $V_1^\vee = \Hom(V_1, \C)$, in which $\hat v_1, \hat v_{-1}$ is the dual basis. This has a $U_q \sl_2-\Mod$ structure given by Equation \ref{eq:dual_mod_struct}.

Up to now we therefore get the following correspondence between the structures on $A$ and those on $A-\Mod^{f.d.}$:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
bialgebra &$\leftrightarrow$& monoidal \\
Hopf algebra &$\leftrightarrow$& right rigid \\
Hopf with $S$ invertible &$\leftrightarrow$& rigid \\
quasi-triangular &$\leftrightarrow$& braiding 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
